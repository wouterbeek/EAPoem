      <line>So am I as the rich whose blessed key<phoneme category="a">key</phoneme></line>
      <line>Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure<phoneme category="b">treasure</phoneme></line>
      <line>The which he will not every hour survey<phoneme category="a">survey</phoneme></line>
      <line>For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure<phoneme category="b">pleasure</phoneme></line>
      <line>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare<phoneme category="c">rare</phoneme></line>
      <line>Since seldom coming in that long year set<phoneme category="d">set</phoneme></line>
      <line>Like stones of worth they thinly placed are<phoneme category="c">are</phoneme></line>
      <line>Or captain jewels in the carcanet<phoneme category="d">carcanet</phoneme></line>
      <line>So is the time that keeps you as my chest<phoneme category="e">chest</phoneme></line>
      <line>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide<phoneme category="f">hide</phoneme></line>
      <line>To make some special instant special-blest<phoneme category="e">special-blest</phoneme></line>
      <line>By new unfolding his imprisoned pride<phoneme category="f">pride</phoneme></line>
      <line>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope<phoneme category="g">scope</phoneme></line>
      <line>Being had to triumph being lacked to hope<phoneme category="g">hope</phoneme></line>
