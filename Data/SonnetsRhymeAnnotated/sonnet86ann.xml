    <stanza>
      <line>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse<phoneme category="a">verse</phoneme></line>
      <line>Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you<phoneme category="b">you</phoneme></line>
      <line>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse<phoneme category="a">inhearse</phoneme></line>
      <line>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew<phoneme category="b">grew</phoneme></line>
      <line>Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write<phoneme category="c">write</phoneme></line>
      <line>Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead<phoneme category="d">dead</phoneme></line>
      <line>No neither he nor his compeers by night<phoneme category="c">night</phoneme></line>
      <line>Giving him aid my verse astonished<phoneme category="d">astonished</phoneme></line>
      <line>He nor that affable familiar ghost<phoneme category="e">ghost</phoneme></line>
      <line>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence<phoneme category="f">intelligence</phoneme></line>
      <line>As victors of my silence cannot boast<phoneme category="e">boast</phoneme></line>
      <line>I was not sick of any fear from thence<phoneme category="f">thence</phoneme></line>
      <line>But when your countenance filled up his line<phoneme category="g">line</phoneme></line>
      <line>Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine<phoneme category="g">mine</phoneme></line>
