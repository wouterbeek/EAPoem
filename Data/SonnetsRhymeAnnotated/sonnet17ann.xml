    <stanza>
      <line>Who will believe my verse in time to come<phoneme category="a">come</phoneme></line>
      <line>If it were filled with your most high deserts<phoneme category="b">deserts</phoneme></line>
      <line>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<phoneme category="a">tomb</phoneme></line>
      <line>Which hides your life and shows not half your parts<phoneme category="b">parts</phoneme></line>
      <line>If I could write the beauty of your eyes<phoneme category="c">eyes</phoneme></line>
      <line>And in fresh numbers number all your graces<phoneme category="d">graces</phoneme></line>
      <line>The age to come would say this poet lies<phoneme category="c">lies</phoneme></line>
      <line>Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces<phoneme category="d">faces</phoneme></line>
      <line>So should my papers (yellowed with their age)<phoneme category="e">age)</phoneme></line>
      <line>Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue<phoneme category="f">tongue</phoneme></line>
      <line>And your true rights be termed a poet rage<phoneme category="e">rage</phoneme></line>
      <line>And stretched metre of an antique song<phoneme category="f">song</phoneme></line>
      <line>But were some child of yours alive that time<phoneme category="g">time</phoneme></line>
      <line>You should live twice in it and in my rhyme<phoneme category="g">rhyme</phoneme></line>
