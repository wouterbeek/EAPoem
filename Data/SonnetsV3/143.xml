    <stanza>
      <line>Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch</line>
      <line>One of her feathered creatures broke away</line>
      <line>Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch</line>
      <line>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay</line>
      <line>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase</line>
      <line>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent</line>
      <line>To follow that which flies before her face</line>
      <line>Not prizing her poor infant discontent</line>
      <line>So run thou after that which flies from thee</line>
      <line>Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind</line>
      <line>But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me</line>
      <line>And play the mother part kiss me be kind</line>
      <line>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will</line>
      <line>If thou turn back and my loud crying still</line>
