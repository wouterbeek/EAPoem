    <stanza>
      <line>Accuse me thus that I have scanted all</line>
      <line>Wherein I should your great deserts repay</line>
      <line>Forgot upon your dearest love to call</line>
      <line>Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day</line>
      <line>That I have frequent been with unknown minds</line>
      <line>And given to time your own dear-purchased right</line>
      <line>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</line>
      <line>Which should transport me farthest from your sight</line>
      <line>Book both my wilfulness and errors down</line>
      <line>And on just proof surmise accumulate</line>
      <line>Bring me within the level of your frown</line>
      <line>But shoot not at me in your wakened hate</line>
      <line>Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</line>
      <line>The constancy and virtue of your love</line>
    </stanza>
