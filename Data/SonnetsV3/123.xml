    <stanza>
      <line>No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change</line>
      <line>Thy pyramids built up with newer might</line>
      <line>To me are nothing novel nothing strange</line>
      <line>They are but dressings Of a former sight</line>
      <line>Our dates are brief and therefore we admire</line>
      <line>What thou dost foist upon us that is old</line>
      <line>And rather make them born to our desire</line>
      <line>Than think that we before have heard them told</line>
      <line>Thy registers and thee I both defy</line>
      <line>Not wondring at the present nor the past</line>
      <line>For thy records and what we see doth lie</line>
      <line>Made more or less by thy continual haste</line>
      <line>This I do vow and this shall ever be</line>
      <line>I will be true despite thy scythe and thee</line>
