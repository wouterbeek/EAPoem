    <stanza>
      <line>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts</line>
      <line>Which I by lacking have supposed dead</line>
      <line>And there reigns love and all love loving parts</line>
      <line>And all those friends which I thought buried</line>
      <line>How many a holy and obsequious tear</line>
      <line>Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye</line>
      <line>As interest of the dead which now appear</line>
      <line>But things removed that hidden in thee lie</line>
      <line>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live</line>
      <line>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone</line>
      <line>Who all their parts of me to thee did give</line>
      <line>That due of many now is thine alone</line>
      <line>Their images I loved I view in thee</line>
      <line>And thou (all they) hast all the all of me</line>
    </stanza>
