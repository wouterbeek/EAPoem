    <stanza>
      <line>Ah wherefore with infection should he live</line>
      <line>And with his presence grace impiety</line>
      <line>That sin by him advantage should achieve</line>
      <line>And lace it self with his society</line>
      <line>Why should false painting imitate his cheek</line>
      <line>And steal dead seeming of his living hue</line>
      <line>Why should poor beauty indirectly seek</line>
      <line>Roses of shadow since his rose is true</line>
      <line>Why should he live now nature bankrupt is</line>
      <line>Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins</line>
      <line>For she hath no exchequer now but his</line>
      <line>And proud of many lives upon his gains</line>
      <line>O him she stores to show what wealth she had</line>
      <line>In days long since before these last so bad</line>
