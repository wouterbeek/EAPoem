    <stanza>
      <line>A woman face with nature own hand painted</line>
      <line>Hast thou the master mistress of my passion</line>
      <line>A woman gentle heart but not acquainted</line>
      <line>With shifting change as is false women fashion</line>
      <line>An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling</line>
      <line>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth</line>
      <line>A man in hue all hues in his controlling</line>
      <line>Which steals men eyes and women souls amazeth</line>
      <line>And for a woman wert thou first created</line>
      <line>Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting</line>
      <line>And by addition me of thee defeated</line>
      <line>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing</line>
      <line>But since she pricked thee out for women pleasure</line>
      <line>Mine be thy love and thy love use their treasure</line>
