    <stanza>
      <line>Those parts of thee that the world eye doth view</line>
      <line>Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend</line>
      <line>All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due</line>
      <line>Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend</line>
      <line>Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned</line>
      <line>But those same tongues that give thee so thine own</line>
      <line>In other accents do this praise confound</line>
      <line>By seeing farther than the eye hath shown</line>
      <line>They look into the beauty of thy mind</line>
      <line>And that in guess they measure by thy deeds</line>
      <line>Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)</line>
      <line>To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds</line>
      <line>But why thy odour matcheth not thy show</line>
      <line>The soil is this that thou dost common grow</line>
