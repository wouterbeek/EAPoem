    <stanza>
      <line>That you were once unkind befriends me now</line>
      <line>And for that sorrow which I then did feel</line>
      <line>Needs must I under my transgression bow</line>
      <line>Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel</line>
      <line>For if you were by my unkindness shaken</line>
      <line>As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time</line>
      <line>And I a tyrant have no leisure taken</line>
      <line>To weigh how once I suffered in your crime</line>
      <line>O that our night of woe might have remembered</line>
      <line>My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits</line>
      <line>And soon to you as you to me then tendered</line>
      <line>The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits</line>
      <line>But that your trespass now becomes a fee</line>
      <line>Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me</line>
    </stanza>
