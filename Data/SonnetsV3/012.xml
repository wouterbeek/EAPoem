    <stanza>
      <line>When I do count the clock that tells the time</line>
      <line>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night</line>
      <line>When I behold the violet past prime</line>
      <line>And sable curls all silvered oer with white</line>
      <line>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves</line>
      <line>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd</line>
      <line>And summer green all girded up in sheaves</line>
      <line>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard</line>
      <line>Then of thy beauty do I question make</line>
      <line>That thou among the wastes of time must go</line>
      <line>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake</line>
      <line>And die as fast as they see others grow</line>
      <line>And nothing gainst Time scythe can make defence</line>
      <line>Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence</line>
