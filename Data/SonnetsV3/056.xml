    <stanza>
      <line>Sweet love renew thy force be it not said</line>
      <line>Thy edge should blunter be than appetite</line>
      <line>Which but to-day by feeding is allayed</line>
      <line>To-morrow sharpened in his former might</line>
      <line>So love be thou although to-day thou fill</line>
      <line>Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness</line>
      <line>To-morrow see again and do not kill</line>
      <line>The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness</line>
      <line>Let this sad interim like the ocean be</line>
      <line>Which parts the shore where two contracted new</line>
      <line>Come daily to the banks that when they see</line>
      <line>Return of love more blest may be the view</line>
      <line>Or call it winter which being full of care</line>
      <line>Makes summer welcome thrice more wished more rare</line>
