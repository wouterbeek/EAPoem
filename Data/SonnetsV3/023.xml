    <stanza>
      <line>As an unperfect actor on the stage</line>
      <line>Who with his fear is put beside his part</line>
      <line>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage</line>
      <line>Whose strength abundance weakens his own heart</line>
      <line>So I for fear of trust forget to say</line>
      <line>The perfect ceremony of love rite</line>
      <line>And in mine own love strength seem to decay</line>
      <line>Oercharged with burthen of mine own love might</line>
      <line>O let my looks be then the eloquence</line>
      <line>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast</line>
      <line>Who plead for love and look for recompense</line>
      <line>More than that tongue that more hath more expressed</line>
      <line>O learn to read what silent love hath writ</line>
      <line>To hear with eyes belongs to love fine wit</line>
    </stanza>
