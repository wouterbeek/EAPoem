    <stanza>
      <line>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears</line>
      <line>Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within</line>
      <line>Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears</line>
      <line>Still losing when I saw my self to win</line>
      <line>What wretched errors hath my heart committed</line>
      <line>Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never</line>
      <line>How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted</line>
      <line>In the distraction of this madding fever</line>
      <line>O benefit of ill now I find true</line>
      <line>That better is by evil still made better</line>
      <line>And ruined love when it is built anew</line>
      <line>Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater</line>
      <line>So I return rebuked to my content</line>
      <line>And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent</line>
    </stanza>
