    <stanza>
      <line>O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</line>
      <line>By that sweet ornament which truth doth give</line>
      <line>The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem</line>
      <line>For that sweet odour which doth in it live</line>
      <line>The canker blooms have full as deep a dye</line>
      <line>As the perfumed tincture of the roses</line>
      <line>Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly</line>
      <line>When summer breath their masked buds discloses</line>
      <line>But for their virtue only is their show</line>
      <line>They live unwooed and unrespected fade</line>
      <line>Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so</line>
      <line>Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made</line>
      <line>And so of you beauteous and lovely youth</line>
      <line>When that shall vade by verse distills your truth</line>
    </stanza>
