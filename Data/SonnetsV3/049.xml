    <stanza>
      <line>Against that time (if ever that time come)</line>
      <line>When I shall see thee frown on my defects</line>
      <line>When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum</line>
      <line>Called to that audit by advised respects</line>
      <line>Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass</line>
      <line>And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye</line>
      <line>When love converted from the thing it was</line>
      <line>Shall reasons find of settled gravity</line>
      <line>Against that time do I ensconce me here</line>
      <line>Within the knowledge of mine own desert</line>
      <line>And this my hand against my self uprear</line>
      <line>To guard the lawful reasons on thy part</line>
      <line>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws</line>
      <line>Since why to love I can allege no cause</line>
