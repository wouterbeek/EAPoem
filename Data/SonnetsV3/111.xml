    <stanza>
      <line>O for my sake do you with Fortune chide</line>
      <line>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds</line>
      <line>That did not better for my life provide</line>
      <line>Than public means which public manners breeds</line>
      <line>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand</line>
      <line>And almost thence my nature is subdued</line>
      <line>To what it works in like the dyer hand</line>
      <line>Pity me then and wish I were renewed</line>
      <line>Whilst like a willing patient I will drink</line>
      <line>Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection</line>
      <line>No bitterness that I will bitter think</line>
      <line>Nor double penance to correct correction</line>
      <line>Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye</line>
      <line>Even that your pity is enough to cure me</line>
