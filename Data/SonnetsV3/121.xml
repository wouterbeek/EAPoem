    <stanza>
      <line>Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed</line>
      <line>When not to be receives reproach of being</line>
      <line>And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed</line>
      <line>Not by our feeling but by others seeing</line>
      <line>For why should others false adulterate eyes</line>
      <line>Give salutation to my sportive blood</line>
      <line>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies</line>
      <line>Which in their wills count bad what I think good</line>
      <line>No I am that I am and they that level</line>
      <line>At my abuses reckon up their own</line>
      <line>I may be straight though they themselves be bevel</line>
      <line>By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown</line>
      <line>Unless this general evil they maintain</line>
      <line>All men are bad and in their badness reign</line>
