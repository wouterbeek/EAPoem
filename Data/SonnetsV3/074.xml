    <stanza>
      <line>But be contented when that fell arrest</line>
      <line>Without all bail shall carry me away</line>
      <line>My life hath in this line some interest</line>
      <line>Which for memorial still with thee shall stay</line>
      <line>When thou reviewest this thou dost review</line>
      <line>The very part was consecrate to thee</line>
      <line>The earth can have but earth which is his due</line>
      <line>My spirit is thine the better part of me</line>
      <line>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life</line>
      <line>The prey of worms my body being dead</line>
      <line>The coward conquest of a wretch knife</line>
      <line>Too base of thee to be remembered</line>
      <line>The worth of that is that which it contains</line>
      <line>And that is this and this with thee remains</line>
    </stanza>
