    <stanza>
      <line>To me fair friend you never can be<phoneme category="a">old</phoneme></line>
      <line>For as you were when first your eye I<phoneme category="b">eyed</phoneme></line>
      <line>Such seems your beauty still three winters<phoneme category="a">cold</phoneme></line>
      <line>Have from the forests shook three summers<phoneme category="b">pride</phoneme></line>
      <line>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn<phoneme category="c">turned</phoneme></line>
      <line>In process of the seasons have I<phoneme category="d">seen</phoneme></line>
      <line>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes<phoneme category="c">burned</phoneme></line>
      <line>Since first I saw you fresh which yet are<phoneme category="d">green</phoneme></line>
      <line>Ah yet doth beauty like a dial<phoneme category="e">hand</phoneme></line>
      <line>Steal from his figure and no pace<phoneme category="f">perceived</phoneme></line>
      <line>So your sweet hue which methinks still doth<phoneme category="e">stand</phoneme></line>
      <line>Hath motion and mine eye may be<phoneme category="f">deceived</phoneme></line>
      <line>For fear of which hear this thou age unbred</line>
      <line>Ere you were born was beauty summer dead</line>
