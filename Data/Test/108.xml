    <stanza>
      <line>What's in the brain that ink may character</line>
      <line>Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit</line>
      <line>What's new to speak what now to register</line>
      <line>That may express my love or thy dear merit</line>
      <line>Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine</line>
      <line>I must each day say o'er the very same</line>
      <line>Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine</line>
      <line>Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name</line>
      <line>So that eternal love in love's fresh case</line>
      <line>Weighs not the dust and injury of age</line>
      <line>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place</line>
      <line>But makes antiquity for aye his page</line>
      <line>Finding the first conceit of love there bred</line>
      <line>Where time and outward form would show it dead</line>
