        <text>Who will believe my verse in time to <a>come</a></text>
        <text>If it were filled with your most high <b>deserts</b></text>
        <text>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a <a>tomb</a></text>
        <text>Which hides your life and shows not half your <b>parts</b></text>
        <text>If I could write the beauty of your <c>eyes</c></text>
        <text>And in fresh numbers number all your <d>graces</d></text>
        <text>The age to come would say this poet <c>lies</c></text>
        <text>Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly <d>faces</d></text>
        <text>So should my papers (yellowed with their <e>age)</e></text>
        <text>Be scorned like old men of less truth than <f>tongue</f></text>
        <text>And your true rights be termed a poet <e>rage</e></text>
        <text>And stretched metre of an antique <f>song</f></text>
        <text>But were some child of yours alive that <g>time</g></text>
        <text>You should live twice in it and in my <g>rhyme</g></text>
