    <stanza>
      <line>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore</line>
      <line>So do our minutes hasten to their end</line>
      <line>Each changing place with that which goes before</line>
      <line>In sequent toil all forwards do contend</line>
      <line>Nativity once in the main of light</line>
      <line>Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned</line>
      <line>Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight</line>
      <line>And Time that gave doth now his gift confound</line>
      <line>Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth</line>
      <line>And delves the parallels in beauty's brow</line>
      <line>Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth</line>
      <line>And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow</line>
      <line>And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand</line>
      <line>Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand</line>
