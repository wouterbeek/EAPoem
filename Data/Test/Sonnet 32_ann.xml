        <text>If thou survive my well-contented <a>day</a></text>
        <text>When that churl death my bones with dust shall <b>cover</b></text>
        <text>And shalt by fortune once more <a>re-survey</a></text>
        <text>These poor rude lines of thy deceased <b>lover</b></text>
        <text>Compare them with the bettring of the <c>time</c></text>
        <text>And though they be outstripped by every <d>pen</d></text>
        <text>Reserve them for my love not for their <c>rhyme</c></text>
        <text>Exceeded by the height of happier <d>men</d></text>
        <text>O then vouchsafe me but this loving <e>thought</e></text>
        <text>Had my friend Muse grown with this growing <f>age</f></text>
        <text>A dearer birth than this his love had <e>brought</e></text>
        <text>To march in ranks of better <f>equipage</f></text>
        <text>But since he died and poets better <g>prove</g></text>
        <text>Theirs for their style Ill read his for his <g>love</g></text>
