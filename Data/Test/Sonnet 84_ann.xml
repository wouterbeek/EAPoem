        <text>Who is it that says most which can say <a>more</a></text>
        <text>Than this rich praise that you alone are <b>you</b></text>
        <text>In whose confine immured is the <a>store</a></text>
        <text>Which should example where your equal <b>grew</b></text>
        <text>Lean penury within that pen doth <c>dwell</c></text>
        <text>That to his subject lends not some small <d>glory</d></text>
        <text>But he that writes of you if he can <c>tell</c></text>
        <text>That you are you so dignifies his <d>story</d></text>
        <text>Let him but copy what in you is <e>writ</e></text>
        <text>Not making worse what nature made so <f>clear</f></text>
        <text>And such a counterpart shall fame his <e>wit</e></text>
        <text>Making his style admired every <f>where</f></text>
        <text>You to your beauteous blessings add a <g>curse</g></text>
        <text>Being fond on praise which makes your praises <g>worse</g></text>
