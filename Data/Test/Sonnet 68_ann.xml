        <text>Thus is his cheek the map of days <a>outworn</a></text>
        <text>When beauty lived and died as flowers do <b>now</b></text>
        <text>Before these bastard signs of fair were <a>born</a></text>
        <text>Or durst inhabit on a living <b>brow</b></text>
        <text>Before the golden tresses of the <c>dead</c></text>
        <text>The right of sepulchres were shorn <d>away</d></text>
        <text>To live a second life on second <c>head</c></text>
        <text>Ere beauty dead fleece made another <d>gay</d></text>
        <text>In him those holy antique hours are <e>seen</e></text>
        <text>Without all ornament it self and <f>true</f></text>
        <text>Making no summer of another <e>green</e></text>
        <text>Robbing no old to dress his beauty <f>new</f></text>
        <text>And him as for a map doth Nature <g>store</g></text>
        <text>To show false Art what beauty was of <g>yore</g></text>
