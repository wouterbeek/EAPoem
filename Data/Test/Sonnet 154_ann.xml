        <text>The little Love-god lying once <a>asleep</a></text>
        <text>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming <b>brand</b></text>
        <text>Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to <a>keep</a></text>
        <text>Came tripping by but in her maiden <b>hand</b></text>
        <text>The fairest votary took up that <c>fire</c></text>
        <text>Which many legions of true hearts had <d>warmed</d></text>
        <text>And so the general of hot <c>desire</c></text>
        <text>Was sleeping by a virgin hand <d>disarmed</d></text>
        <text>This brand she quenched in a cool well <e>by</e></text>
        <text>Which from Love fire took heat <f>perpetual</f></text>
        <text>Growing a bath and healthful <e>remedy</e></text>
        <text>For men discased but I my mistress <f>thrall</f></text>
        <text>Came there for cure and this by that I <g>prove</g></text>
        <text>Love fire heats water water cools not <g>love</g></text>
