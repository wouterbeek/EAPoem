    <stanza>
      <line>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye</line>
      <line>That thou consum'st thy self in single life</line>
      <line>Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die</line>
      <line>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife</line>
      <line>The world will be thy widow and still weep</line>
      <line>That thou no form of thee hast left behind</line>
      <line>When every private widow well may keep</line>
      <line>By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind</line>
      <line>Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</line>
      <line>Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it</line>
      <line>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end</line>
      <line>And kept unused the user so destroys it</line>
      <line>No love toward others in that bosom sits</line>
      <line>That on himself such murd'rous shame commits</line>
