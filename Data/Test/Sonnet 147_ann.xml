        <text>My love is as a fever longing <a>still</a></text>
        <text>For that which longer nurseth the <b>disease</b></text>
        <text>Feeding on that which doth preserve the <a>ill</a></text>
        <text>Th uncertain sickly appetite to <b>please</b></text>
        <text>My reason the physician to my <c>love</c></text>
        <text>Angry that his prescriptions are not <d>kept</d></text>
        <text>Hath left me and I desperate now <c>approve</c></text>
        <text>Desire is death which physic did <d>except</d></text>
        <text>Past cure I am now reason is past <e>care</e></text>
        <text>And frantic-mad with evermore <f>unrest</f></text>
        <text>My thoughts and my discourse as mad men <e>are</e></text>
        <text>At random from the truth vainly <f>expressed</f></text>
        <text>For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee <g>bright</g></text>
        <text>Who art as black as hell as dark as <g>night</g></text>
