      <line>
        <text>So are you to my thoughts as food to <a>life</a></text>
        <text>Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the <b>ground</b></text>
        <text>And for the peace of you I hold such <a>strife</a></text>
        <text>As twixt a miser and his wealth is <b>found</b></text>
        <text>Now proud as an enjoyer and <c>anon</c></text>
        <text>Doubting the filching age will steal his <d>treasure</d></text>
        <text>Now counting best to be with you <c>alone</c></text>
        <text>Then bettered that the world may see my <d>pleasure</d></text>
        <text>Sometime all full with feasting on your <e>sight</e></text>
        <text>And by and by clean starved for a <f>look</f></text>
        <text>Possessing or pursuing no <e>delight</e></text>
        <text>Save what is had or must from you be <f>took</f></text>
        <text>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by <g>day</g></text>
        <text>Or gluttoning on all or all <g>away</g></text>
