    <stanza>
      <line>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun</line>
      <line>Coral is far more red than her lips red</line>
      <line>If snow be white why then her breasts are dun</line>
      <line>If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head</line>
      <line>I have seen roses damasked red and white</line>
      <line>But no such roses see I in her cheeks</line>
      <line>And in some perfumes is there more delight</line>
      <line>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks</line>
      <line>I love to hear her speak yet well I know</line>
      <line>That music hath a far more pleasing sound</line>
      <line>I grant I never saw a goddess go</line>
      <line>My mistress when she walks treads on the ground</line>
      <line>And yet by heaven I think my love as rare</line>
      <line>As any she belied with false compare</line>
