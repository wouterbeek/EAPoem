        <text>To me fair friend you never can be <a>old</a></text>
        <text>For as you were when first your eye I <b>eyed</b></text>
        <text>Such seems your beauty still three winters <a>cold</a></text>
        <text>Have from the forests shook three summers <b>pride</b></text>
        <text>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn <c>turned</c></text>
        <text>In process of the seasons have I <d>seen</d></text>
        <text>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes <c>burned</c></text>
        <text>Since first I saw you fresh which yet are <d>green</d></text>
        <text>Ah yet doth beauty like a dial <e>hand</e></text>
        <text>Steal from his figure and no pace <f>perceived</f></text>
        <text>So your sweet hue which methinks still doth <e>stand</e></text>
        <text>Hath motion and mine eye may be <f>deceived</f></text>
        <text>For fear of which hear this thou age <g>unbred</g></text>
        <text>Ere you were born was beauty summer <g>dead</g></text>
