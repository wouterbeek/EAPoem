        <text>I never saw that you did painting <a>need</a></text>
        <text>And therefore to your fair no painting <b>set</b></text>
        <text>I found (or thought I found) you did <a>exceed</a></text>
        <text>That barren tender of a poet <b>debt</b></text>
        <text>And therefore have I slept in your <c>report</c></text>
        <text>That you your self being extant well might <d>show</d></text>
        <text>How far a modern quill doth come too <c>short</c></text>
        <text>Speaking of worth what worth in you doth <d>grow</d></text>
        <text>This silence for my sin you did <e>impute</e></text>
        <text>Which shall be most my glory being <f>dumb</f></text>
        <text>For I impair not beauty being <e>mute</e></text>
        <text>When others would give life and bring a <f>tomb</f></text>
        <text>There lives more life in one of your fair <g>eyes</g></text>
        <text>Than both your poets can in praise <g>devise</g></text>
