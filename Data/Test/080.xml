    <stanza>
      <line>O how I faint when I of you do write</line>
      <line>Knowing a better spirit doth use your name</line>
      <line>And in the praise thereof spends all his might</line>
      <line>To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame</line>
      <line>But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)</line>
      <line>The humble as the proudest sail doth bear</line>
      <line>My saucy bark (inferior far to his)</line>
      <line>On your broad main doth wilfully appear</line>
      <line>Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat</line>
      <line>Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride</line>
      <line>Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat</line>
      <line>He of tall building and of goodly pride</line>
      <line>Then if he thrive and I be cast away</line>
      <line>The worst was this my love was my decay</line>
