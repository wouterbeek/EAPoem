    <stanza>
      <line>Those lines that I before have writ do lie</line>
      <line>Even those that said I could not love you dearer</line>
      <line>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</line>
      <line>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer</line>
      <line>But reckoning time whose millioned accidents</line>
      <line>Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings</line>
      <line>Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents</line>
      <line>Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things</line>
      <line>Alas why fearing of time's tyranny</line>
      <line>Might I not then say 'Now I love you best'</line>
      <line>When I was certain o'er incertainty</line>
      <line>Crowning the present doubting of the rest</line>
      <line>Love is a babe then might I not say so</line>
      <line>To give full growth to that which still doth grow</line>
