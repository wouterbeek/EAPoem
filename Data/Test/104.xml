    <stanza>
      <line>To me fair friend you never can be old</line>
      <line>For as you were when first your eye I eyed</line>
      <line>Such seems your beauty still three winters cold</line>
      <line>Have from the forests shook three summers' pride</line>
      <line>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned</line>
      <line>In process of the seasons have I seen</line>
      <line>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned</line>
      <line>Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green</line>
      <line>Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand</line>
      <line>Steal from his figure and no pace perceived</line>
      <line>So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand</line>
      <line>Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived</line>
      <line>For fear of which hear this thou age unbred</line>
      <line>Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead</line>
    </stanza>
