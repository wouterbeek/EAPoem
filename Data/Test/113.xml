    <stanza>
      <line>Since I left you mine eye is in my mind</line>
      <line>And that which governs me to go about</line>
      <line>Doth part his function and is partly blind</line>
      <line>Seems seeing but effectually is out</line>
      <line>For it no form delivers to the heart</line>
      <line>Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch</line>
      <line>Of his quick objects hath the mind no part</line>
      <line>Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch</line>
      <line>For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight</line>
      <line>The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature</line>
      <line>The mountain or the sea the day or night</line>
      <line>The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature</line>
      <line>Incapable of more replete with you</line>
      <line>My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue</line>
