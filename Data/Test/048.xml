    <stanza>
      <line>How careful was I when I took my way</line>
      <line>Each trifle under truest bars to thrust</line>
      <line>That to my use it might unused stay</line>
      <line>From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust</line>
      <line>But thou to whom my jewels trifles are</line>
      <line>Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief</line>
      <line>Thou best of dearest and mine only care</line>
      <line>Art left the prey of every vulgar thief</line>
      <line>Thee have I not locked up in any chest</line>
      <line>Save where thou art not though I feel thou art</line>
      <line>Within the gentle closure of my breast</line>
      <line>From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part</line>
      <line>And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear</line>
      <line>For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear</line>
