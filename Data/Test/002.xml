    <stanza>
      <line>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow</line>
      <line>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field</line>
      <line>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now</line>
      <line>Will be a tattered weed of small worth held</line>
      <line>Then being asked where all thy beauty lies</line>
      <line>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days</line>
      <line>To say within thine own deep sunken eyes</line>
      <line>Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise</line>
      <line>How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use</line>
      <line>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</line>
      <line>Shall sum my count and make my old excuse'</line>
      <line>Proving his beauty by succession thine</line>
      <line>This were to be new made when thou art old</line>
      <line>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold</line>
