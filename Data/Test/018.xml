    <stanza>
      <line>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day</line>
      <line>Thou art more lovely and more temperate</line>
      <line>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May</line>
      <line>And summer's lease hath all too short a date</line>
      <line>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines</line>
      <line>And often is his gold complexion dimmed</line>
      <line>And every fair from fair sometime declines</line>
      <line>By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed</line>
      <line>But thy eternal summer shall not fade</line>
      <line>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st</line>
      <line>Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade</line>
      <line>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st</line>
      <line>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see</line>
      <line>So long lives this and this gives life to thee</line>
