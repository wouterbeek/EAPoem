        <text>So am I as the rich whose blessed <a>key</a></text>
        <text>Can bring him to his sweet up-locked <b>treasure</b></text>
        <text>The which he will not every hour <a>survey</a></text>
        <text>For blunting the fine point of seldom <b>pleasure</b></text>
        <text>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so <c>rare</c></text>
        <text>Since seldom coming in that long year <d>set</d></text>
        <text>Like stones of worth they thinly placed <c>are</c></text>
        <text>Or captain jewels in the <d>carcanet</d></text>
        <text>So is the time that keeps you as my <e>chest</e></text>
        <text>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth <f>hide</f></text>
        <text>To make some special instant <e>special-blest</e></text>
        <text>By new unfolding his imprisoned <f>pride</f></text>
        <text>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives <g>scope</g></text>
        <text>Being had to triumph being lacked to <g>hope</g></text>
