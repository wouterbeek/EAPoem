    <stanza>
      <line>From fairest creatures we desire increase</line>
      <line>That thereby beauty's rose might never die</line>
      <line>But as the riper should by time decease</line>
      <line>His tender heir might bear his memory</line>
      <line>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes</line>
      <line>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel</line>
      <line>Making a famine where abundance lies</line>
      <line>Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel</line>
      <line>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament</line>
      <line>And only herald to the gaudy spring</line>
      <line>Within thine own bud buriest thy content</line>
      <line>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding</line>
      <line>Pity the world or else this glutton be</line>
      <line>To eat the world's due by the grave and thee</line>
