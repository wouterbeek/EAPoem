        <text>How heavy do I journey on the <a>way</a></text>
        <text>When what I seek (my weary travel <b>end)</b></text>
        <text>Doth teach that case and that repose to <a>say</a></text>
        <text>Thus far the miles are measured from thy <b>friend</b></text>
        <text>The beast that bears me tired with my <c>woe</c></text>
        <text>Plods dully on to bear that weight in <d>me</d></text>
        <text>As if by some instinct the wretch did <c>know</c></text>
        <text>His rider loved not speed being made from <d>thee</d></text>
        <text>The bloody spur cannot provoke him <e>on</e></text>
        <text>That sometimes anger thrusts into his <f>hide</f></text>
        <text>Which heavily he answers with a <e>groan</e></text>
        <text>More sharp to me than spurring to his <f>side</f></text>
        <text>For that same groan doth put this in my <g>mind</g></text>
        <text>My grief lies onward and my joy <g>behind</g></text>
