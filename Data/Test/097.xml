    <stanza>
      <line>How like a winter hath my absence been</line>
      <line>From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year</line>
      <line>What freezings have I felt what dark days seen</line>
      <line>What old December's bareness everywhere</line>
      <line>And yet this time removed was summer's time</line>
      <line>The teeming autumn big with rich increase</line>
      <line>Bearing the wanton burden of the prime</line>
      <line>Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease</line>
      <line>Yet this abundant issue seemed to me</line>
      <line>But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit</line>
      <line>For summer and his pleasures wait on thee</line>
      <line>And thou away the very birds are mute</line>
      <line>Or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer</line>
      <line>That leaves look pale dreading the winter's near</line>
