    <stanza>
      <line>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the (a)sun(/a)</line>
      <line>Coral is far more red than her lips (b)red(/b)</line>
      <line>If snow be white why then her breasts are (a)dun(/a)</line>
      <line>If hairs be wires black wires grow on her (b)head(/b)</line>
      <line>I have seen roses damasked red and (c)white(/c)</line>
      <line>But no such roses see I in her (d)cheeks(/d)</line>
      <line>And in some perfumes is there more (c)delight(/c)</line>
      <line>Than in the breath that from my mistress (d)reeks(/d)</line>
      <line>I love to hear her speak yet well I (e)know(/e)</line>
      <line>That music hath a far more pleasing (f)sound(/f)</line>
      <line>I grant I never saw a goddess (e)go(/e)</line>
      <line>My mistress when she walks treads on the (f)ground(/f)</line>
      <line>And yet by heaven I think my love as (g)rare(/g)</line>
      <line>As any she belied with false (g)compare(/g)</line>
