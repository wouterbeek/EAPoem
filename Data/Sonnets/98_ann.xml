    <stanza>
      <line>From you have I been absent in the (a)spring(/a)</line>
      <line>When proud-pied April (dressed in all his (b)trim)(/b)</line>
      <line>Hath put a spirit of youth in every (a)thing(/a)</line>
      <line>That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with (b)him(/b)</line>
      <line>Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet (c)smell(/c)</line>
      <line>Of different flowers in odour and in (d)hue(/d)</line>
      <line>Could make me any summer's story (c)tell(/c)</line>
      <line>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they (d)grew(/d)</line>
      <line>Nor did I wonder at the lily's (e)white(/e)</line>
      <line>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the (f)rose(/f)</line>
      <line>They were but sweet but figures of (e)delight(/e)</line>
      <line>Drawn after you you pattern of all (f)those(/f)</line>
      <line>Yet seemed it winter still and you (g)away(/g)</line>
      <line>As with your shadow I with these did (g)play(/g)</line>
