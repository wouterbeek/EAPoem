    <stanza>
      <line>But be contented when that fell <a>arrest</a></line>
      <line>Without all bail shall carry me <b>away</b></line>
      <line>My life hath in this line some <a>interest</a></line>
      <line>Which for memorial still with thee shall <b>stay</b></line>
      <line>When thou reviewest this thou dost <c>review</c></line>
      <line>The very part was consecrate to <d>thee</d></line>
      <line>The earth can have but earth which is his <c>due</c></line>
      <line>My spirit is thine the better part of <d>me</d></line>
      <line>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of <e>life</e></line>
      <line>The prey of worms my body being <f>dead</f></line>
      <line>The coward conquest of a wretch's <e>knife</e></line>
      <line>Too base of thee to be <f>remembered</f></line>
      <line>The worth of that is that which it <g>contains</g></line>
      <line>And that is this and this with thee <g>remains</g></line>
