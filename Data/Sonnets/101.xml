    <stanza>
      <line>O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,</line>
      <line>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?</line>
      <line>Both truth and beauty on my love depends:</line>
      <line>So dost thou too, and therein dignified:</line>
      <line>Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,</line>
      <line>'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,</line>
      <line>Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:</line>
      <line>But best is best, if never intermixed'?</line>
      <line>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</line>
      <line>Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,</line>
      <line>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:</line>
      <line>And to be praised of ages yet to be.</line>
      <line>Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,</line>
      <line>To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.</line>
