    <stanza>
      <line>Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness</line>
      <line>Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport</line>
      <line>Both grace and faults are loved of more and less</line>
      <line>Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort</line>
      <line>As on the finger of a throned queen</line>
      <line>The basest jewel will be well esteemed</line>
      <line>So are those errors that in thee are seen</line>
      <line>To truths translated and for true things deemed</line>
      <line>How many lambs might the stern wolf betray</line>
      <line>If like a lamb he could his looks translate</line>
      <line>How many gazers mightst thou lead away</line>
      <line>if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state</line>
      <line>But do not so I love thee in such sort</line>
      <line>As thou being mine mine is thy good report</line>
