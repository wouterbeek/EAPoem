      <line>What is your substance whereof are you (a)made(/a)</line>
      <line>That millions of strange shadows on you (b)tend(/b)</line>
      <line>Since every one hath every one one (a)shade(/a)</line>
      <line>And you but one can every shadow (b)lend(/b)</line>
      <line>Describe Adonis and the (c)counterfeit(/c)</line>
      <line>Is poorly imitated after (d)you(/d)</line>
      <line>On Helen's cheek all art of beauty (c)set(/c)</line>
      <line>And you in Grecian tires are painted (d)new(/d)</line>
      <line>Speak of the spring and foison of the (e)year(/e)</line>
      <line>The one doth shadow of your beauty (f)show(/f)</line>
      <line>The other as your bounty doth (e)appear(/e)</line>
      <line>And you in every blessed shape we (f)know(/f)</line>
      <line>In all external grace you have some (g)part(/g)</line>
      <line>But you like none none you for constant (g)heart(/g)</line>
