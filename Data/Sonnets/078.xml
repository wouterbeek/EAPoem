    <stanza>
      <line>So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,</line>
      <line>And found such fair assistance in my verse,</line>
      <line>As every alien pen hath got my use,</line>
      <line>And under thee their poesy disperse.</line>
      <line>Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,</line>
      <line>And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</line>
      <line>Have added feathers to the learned's wing,</line>
      <line>And given grace a double majesty.</line>
      <line>Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</line>
      <line>Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,</line>
      <line>In others' works thou dost but mend the style,</line>
      <line>And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.</line>
      <line>But thou art all my art, and dost advance</line>
      <line>As high as learning, my rude ignorance.</line>
