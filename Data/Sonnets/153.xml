    <stanza>
      <line>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep</line>
      <line>A maid of Dian this advantage found</line>
      <line>And his love kindling fire did quickly steep</line>
      <line>In a cold valley fountain of that ground</line>
      <line>Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love</line>
      <line>A dateless lively heat still to endure</line>
      <line>And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove</line>
      <line>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure</line>
      <line>But at my mistress eye Love brand new fired</line>
      <line>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast</line>
      <line>I sick withal the help of bath desired</line>
      <line>And thither hied a sad distempered guest</line>
      <line>But found no cure the bath for my help lies</line>
      <line>Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes</line>
    </stanza>
