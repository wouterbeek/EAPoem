    <stanza>
      <line>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled (a)shore(/a)</line>
      <line>So do our minutes hasten to their (b)end(/b)</line>
      <line>Each changing place with that which goes (a)before(/a)</line>
      <line>In sequent toil all forwards do (b)contend(/b)</line>
      <line>Nativity once in the main of (c)light(/c)</line>
      <line>Crawls to maturity wherewith being (d)crowned(/d)</line>
      <line>Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory (c)fight(/c)</line>
      <line>And Time that gave doth now his gift (d)confound(/d)</line>
      <line>Time doth transfix the flourish set on (e)youth(/e)</line>
      <line>And delves the parallels in beauty's (f)brow(/f)</line>
      <line>Feeds on the rarities of nature's (e)truth(/e)</line>
      <line>And nothing stands but for his scythe to (f)mow(/f)</line>
      <line>And yet to times in hope my verse shall (g)stand(/g)</line>
      <line>Praising thy worth despite his cruel (g)hand(/g)</line>
