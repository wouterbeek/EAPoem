    <stanza>
      <line>They that have power to hurt, and will do none,</line>
      <line>That do not do the thing, they most do show,</line>
      <line>Who moving others, are themselves as stone,</line>
      <line>Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:</line>
      <line>They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,</line>
      <line>And husband nature's riches from expense,</line>
      <line>Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,</line>
      <line>Others, but stewards of their excellence:</line>
      <line>The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,</line>
      <line>Though to it self, it only live and die,</line>
      <line>But if that flower with base infection meet,</line>
      <line>The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</line>
      <line>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,</line>
      <line>Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</line>
