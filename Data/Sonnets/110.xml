    <stanza>
      <line>Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,</line>
      <line>And made my self a motley to the view,</line>
      <line>Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</line>
      <line>Made old offences of affections new.</line>
      <line>Most true it is, that I have looked on truth</line>
      <line>Askance and strangely: but by all above,</line>
      <line>These blenches gave my heart another youth,</line>
      <line>And worse essays proved thee my best of love.</line>
      <line>Now all is done, have what shall have no end,</line>
      <line>Mine appetite I never more will grind</line>
      <line>On newer proof, to try an older friend,</line>
      <line>A god in love, to whom I am confined.</line>
      <line>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,</line>
      <line>Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</line>
