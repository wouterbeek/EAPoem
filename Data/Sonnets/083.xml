    <stanza>
      <line>I never saw that you did painting need</line>
      <line>And therefore to your fair no painting set</line>
      <line>I found (or thought I found) you did exceed</line>
      <line>That barren tender of a poet's debt</line>
      <line>And therefore have I slept in your report</line>
      <line>That you your self being extant well might show</line>
      <line>How far a modern quill doth come too short</line>
      <line>Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow</line>
      <line>This silence for my sin you did impute</line>
      <line>Which shall be most my glory being dumb</line>
      <line>For I impair not beauty being mute</line>
      <line>When others would give life and bring a tomb</line>
      <line>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</line>
      <line>Than both your poets can in praise devise</line>
