    <stanza>
      <line>Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame</line>
      <line>Is lust in action, and till action, lust</line>
      <line>Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,</line>
      <line>Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,</line>
      <line>Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,</line>
      <line>Past reason hunted, and no sooner had</line>
      <line>Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,</line>
      <line>On purpose laid to make the taker mad.</line>
      <line>Mad in pursuit and in possession so,</line>
      <line>Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,</line>
      <line>A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,</line>
      <line>Before a joy proposed behind a dream.</line>
      <line>All this the world well knows yet none knows well,</line>
      <line>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</line>
