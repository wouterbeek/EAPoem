    <stanza>
      <line>Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,</line>
      <line>When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</line>
      <line>Before these bastard signs of fair were born,</line>
      <line>Or durst inhabit on a living brow:</line>
      <line>Before the golden tresses of the dead,</line>
      <line>The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,</line>
      <line>To live a second life on second head,</line>
      <line>Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:</line>
      <line>In him those holy antique hours are seen,</line>
      <line>Without all ornament, it self and true,</line>
      <line>Making no summer of another's green,</line>
      <line>Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,</line>
      <line>And him as for a map doth Nature store,</line>
      <line>To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</line>
