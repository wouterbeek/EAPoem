    <stanza>
      <line>Music to hear why hear thou music sadly</line>
      <line>Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy</line>
      <line>Why lov thou that which thou receiv not gladly</line>
      <line>Or else receiv with pleasure thine annoy</line>
      <line>If the true concord of well tuned sounds</line>
      <line>By unions married do offend thine ear</line>
      <line>They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds</line>
      <line>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear</line>
      <line>Mark how one string sweet husband to another</line>
      <line>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering</line>
      <line>Resembling sire and child and happy mother</line>
      <line>Who all in one one pleasing note do sing</line>
      <line>Whose speechless song being many seeming one</line>
      <line>Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none</line>
