    <stanza>
      <line>Those hours that with gentle work did <a>frame</a></line>
      <line>The lovely gaze where every eye doth <b>dwell</b></line>
      <line>Will play the tyrants to the very <a>same</a></line>
      <line>And that unfair which fairly doth <b>excel</b></line>
      <line>For never-resting time leads summer <c>on</c></line>
      <line>To hideous winter and confounds him <d>there</d></line>
      <line>Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite <c>gone</c></line>
      <line>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every <d>where</d></line>
      <line>Then were not summer's distillation <e>left</e></line>
      <line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of <f>glass</f></line>
      <line>Beauty's effect with beauty were <e>bereft</e></line>
      <line>Nor it nor no remembrance what it <f>was</f></line>
      <line>But flowers distilled though they with winter <g>meet</g></line>
      <line>Leese but their show their substance still lives <g>sweet</g></line>
