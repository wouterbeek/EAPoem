    <stanza>
      <line>Sweet love renew thy force be it not (a)said(/a)</line>
      <line>Thy edge should blunter be than (b)appetite(/b)</line>
      <line>Which but to-day by feeding is (a)allayed(/a)</line>
      <line>To-morrow sharpened in his former (b)might(/b)</line>
      <line>So love be thou although to-day thou (c)fill(/c)</line>
      <line>Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with (d)fulness(/d)</line>
      <line>To-morrow see again and do not (c)kill(/c)</line>
      <line>The spirit of love with a perpetual (d)dulness(/d)</line>
      <line>Let this sad interim like the ocean (e)be(/e)</line>
      <line>Which parts the shore where two contracted (f)new(/f)</line>
      <line>Come daily to the banks that when they (e)see(/e)</line>
      <line>Return of love more blest may be the (f)view(/f)</line>
      <line>Or call it winter which being full of (g)care(/g)</line>
      <line>Makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more (g)rare(/g)</line>
