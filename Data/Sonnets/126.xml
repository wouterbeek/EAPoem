    <stanza>
      <line>O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,</line>
      <line>Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:</line>
      <line>Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,</line>
      <line>Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.</line>
      <line>If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)</line>
      <line>As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,</line>
      <line>She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</line>
      <line>May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.</line>
      <line>Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,</line>
      <line>She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!</line>
      <line>Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,</line>
      <line>And her quietus is to render thee.</line>
