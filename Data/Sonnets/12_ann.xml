    <stanza>
      <line>When I do count the clock that tells the (a)time(/a)</line>
      <line>And see the brave day sunk in hideous (b)night(/b)</line>
      <line>When I behold the violet past (a)prime(/a)</line>
      <line>And sable curls all silvered o'er with (b)white(/b)</line>
      <line>When lofty trees I see barren of (c)leaves(/c)</line>
      <line>Which erst from heat did canopy the (d)herd(/d)</line>
      <line>And summer's green all girded up in (c)sheaves(/c)</line>
      <line>Borne on the bier with white and bristly (d)beard(/d)</line>
      <line>Then of thy beauty do I question (e)make(/e)</line>
      <line>That thou among the wastes of time must (f)go(/f)</line>
      <line>Since sweets and beauties do themselves (e)forsake(/e)</line>
      <line>And die as fast as they see others (f)grow(/f)</line>
      <line>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make (g)defence(/g)</line>
      <line>Save breed to brave him when he takes thee (g)hence(/g)</line>
