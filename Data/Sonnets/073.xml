    <stanza>
      <line>That time of year thou mayst in me behold</line>
      <line>When yellow leaves or none or few do hang</line>
      <line>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold</line>
      <line>Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang</line>
      <line>In me thou seest the twilight of such day</line>
      <line>As after sunset fadeth in the west</line>
      <line>Which by and by black night doth take away</line>
      <line>Death's second self that seals up all in rest</line>
      <line>In me thou seest the glowing of such fire</line>
      <line>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie</line>
      <line>As the death-bed whereon it must expire</line>
      <line>Consumed with that which it was nourished by</line>
      <line>This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong</line>
      <line>To love that well which thou must leave ere long</line>
    </stanza>
