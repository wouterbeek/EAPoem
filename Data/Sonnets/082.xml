    <stanza>
      <line>I grant thou wert not married to my muse,</line>
      <line>And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook</line>
      <line>The dedicated words which writers use</line>
      <line>Of their fair subject, blessing every book.</line>
      <line>Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,</line>
      <line>Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,</line>
      <line>And therefore art enforced to seek anew,</line>
      <line>Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.</line>
      <line>And do so love, yet when they have devised,</line>
      <line>What strained touches rhetoric can lend,</line>
      <line>Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,</line>
      <line>In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.</line>
      <line>And their gross painting might be better used,</line>
      <line>Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.</line>
