    <stanza>
      <line>Against my love shall be as I am <a>now</a></line>
      <line>With Time's injurious hand crushed and <b>o'erworn</b></line>
      <line>When hours have drained his blood and filled his <a>brow</a></line>
      <line>With lines and wrinkles when his youthful <b>morn</b></line>
      <line>Hath travelled on to age's steepy <c>night</c></line>
      <line>And all those beauties whereof now he's <d>king</d></line>
      <line>Are vanishing or vanished out of <c>sight</c></line>
      <line>Stealing away the treasure of his <d>spring</d></line>
      <line>For such a time do I now <e>fortify</e></line>
      <line>Against confounding age's cruel <f>knife</f></line>
      <line>That he shall never cut from <e>memory</e></line>
      <line>My sweet love's beauty though my lover's <f>life</f></line>
      <line>His beauty shall in these black lines be <g>seen</g></line>
      <line>And they shall live and he in them still <g>green</g></line>
