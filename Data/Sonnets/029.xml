    <stanza>
      <line>When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,</line>
      <line>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</line>
      <line>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</line>
      <line>And look upon my self and curse my fate,</line>
      <line>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</line>
      <line>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</line>
      <line>Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,</line>
      <line>With what I most enjoy contented least,</line>
      <line>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</line>
      <line>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</line>
      <line>(Like to the lark at break of day arising</line>
      <line>From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,</line>
      <line>For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,</line>
      <line>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</line>
