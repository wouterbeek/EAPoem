    <stanza>
      <line>Against my love shall be as I am now</line>
      <line>With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,</line>
      <line>When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow</line>
      <line>With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn</line>
      <line>Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,</line>
      <line>And all those beauties whereof now he's king</line>
      <line>Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,</line>
      <line>Stealing away the treasure of his spring:</line>
      <line>For such a time do I now fortify</line>
      <line>Against confounding age's cruel knife,</line>
      <line>That he shall never cut from memory</line>
      <line>My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.</line>
      <line>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</line>
      <line>And they shall live, and he in them still green.</line>
