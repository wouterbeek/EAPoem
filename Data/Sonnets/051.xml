    <stanza>
      <line>Can my love excuse the slow offence,</line>
      <line>Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,</line>
      <line>From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?</line>
      <line>Till I return of posting is no need.</line>
      <line>O what excuse will my poor beast then find,</line>
      <line>When swift extremity can seem but slow?</line>
      <line>Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,</line>
      <line>In winged speed no motion shall I know,</line>
      <line>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,</line>
      <line>Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)</line>
      <line>Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,</line>
      <line>But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,</line>
      <line>Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,</line>
      <line>Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.</line>
