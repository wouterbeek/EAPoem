    <stanza>
      <line>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day</line>
      <line>And make me travel forth without my cloak</line>
      <line>To let base clouds oertake me in my way</line>
      <line>Hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke</line>
      <line>Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break</line>
      <line>To dry the rain on my storm beaten face</line>
      <line>For no man well of such a salve can speak</line>
      <line>That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace</line>
      <line>Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief</line>
      <line>Though thou repent yet I have still the loss</line>
      <line>Th offender sorrow lends but weak relief</line>
      <line>To him that bears the strong offence cross</line>
      <line>Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds</line>
      <line>And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds</line>
