    <stanza>
      <line>Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will</line>
      <line>And Will to boot and Will in over plus</line>
      <line>More than enough am I that vex thee still</line>
      <line>To thy sweet will making addition thus</line>
      <line>Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious</line>
      <line>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine</line>
      <line>Shall will in others seem right gracious</line>
      <line>And in my will no fair acceptance shine</line>
      <line>The sea all water yet receives rain still</line>
      <line>And in abundance addeth to his store</line>
      <line>So thou being rich in will add to thy will</line>
      <line>One will of mine to make thy large will more</line>
      <line>Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill</line>
      <line>Think all but one and me in that one Will</line>
