    <stanza>
      <line>Mine eye hath played the painter and hath <a>stelled</a></line>
      <line>Thy beauty's form in table of my <b>heart</b></line>
      <line>My body is the frame wherein 'tis <a>held</a></line>
      <line>And perspective it is best painter's <b>art</b></line>
      <line>For through the painter must you see his <c>skill</c></line>
      <line>To find where your true image pictured <d>lies</d></line>
      <line>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging <c>still</c></line>
      <line>That hath his windows glazed with thine <d>eyes</d></line>
      <line>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have <e>done</e></line>
      <line>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for <f>me</f></line>
      <line>Are windows to my breast where-through the <e>sun</e></line>
      <line>Delights to peep to gaze therein on <f>thee</f></line>
      <line>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their <g>art</g></line>
      <line>They draw but what they see know not the <g>heart</g></line>
