    <stanza>
      <line>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,</line>
      <line>As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;</line>
      <line>For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart</line>
      <line>Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.</line>
      <line>Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,</line>
      <line>Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;</line>
      <line>To say they err, I dare not be so bold,</line>
      <line>Although I swear it to my self alone.</line>
      <line>And to be sure that is not false I swear,</line>
      <line>A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,</line>
      <line>One on another's neck do witness bear</line>
      <line>Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.</line>
      <line>In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,</line>
      <line>And thence this slander as I think proceeds.</line>
