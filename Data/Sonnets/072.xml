    <stanza>
      <line>O lest the world should task you to recite</line>
      <line>What merit lived in me that you should love</line>
      <line>After my death (dear love) forget me quite</line>
      <line>For you in me can nothing worthy prove</line>
      <line>Unless you would devise some virtuous lie</line>
      <line>To do more for me than mine own desert</line>
      <line>And hang more praise upon deceased I</line>
      <line>Than niggard truth would willingly impart</line>
      <line>O lest your true love may seem false in this</line>
      <line>That you for love speak well of me untrue</line>
      <line>My name be buried where my body is</line>
      <line>And live no more to shame nor me nor you</line>
      <line>For I am shamed by that which I bring forth</line>
      <line>And so should you to love things nothing worth</line>
