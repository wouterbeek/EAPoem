    <stanza>
      <line>Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,</line>
      <line>When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</line>
      <line>Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,</line>
      <line>For still temptation follows where thou art.</line>
      <line>Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,</line>
      <line>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.</line>
      <line>And when a woman woos, what woman's son,</line>
      <line>Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?</line>
      <line>Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,</line>
      <line>And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,</line>
      <line>Who lead thee in their riot even there</line>
      <line>Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:</line>
      <line>Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,</line>
      <line>Thine by thy beauty being false to me.</line>
