    <stanza>
      <line>When I consider every thing that grows</line>
      <line>Holds in perfection but a little moment</line>
      <line>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
      <line>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment</line>
      <line>When I perceive that men as plants increase</line>
      <line>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky</line>
      <line>Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease</line>
      <line>And wear their brave state out of memory</line>
      <line>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
      <line>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight</line>
      <line>Where wasteful time debateth with decay</line>
      <line>To change your day of youth to sullied night</line>
      <line>And all in war with Time for love of you</line>
      <line>As he takes from you I engraft you new</line>
