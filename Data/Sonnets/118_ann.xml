      <line>Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying (c)sweetness(/c)</line>
      <line>To bitter sauces did I frame my (d)feeding(/d)</line>
      <line>And sick of welfare found a kind of (c)meetness(/c)</line>
      <line>To be diseased ere that there was true (d)needing(/d)</line>
      <line>Thus policy in love t' (e)anticipate(/e)</line>
      <line>The ills that were not grew to faults (f)assured(/f)</line>
      <line>And brought to medicine a healthful (e)state(/e)</line>
      <line>Which rank of goodness would by ill be (f)cured(/f)</line>
