    <stanza>
      <line>Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,</line>
      <line>With my extern the outward honouring,</line>
      <line>Or laid great bases for eternity,</line>
      <line>Which proves more short than waste or ruining?</line>
      <line>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour</line>
      <line>Lose all, and more by paying too much rent</line>
      <line>For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,</line>
      <line>Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?</line>
      <line>No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,</line>
      <line>And take thou my oblation, poor but free,</line>
      <line>Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,</line>
      <line>But mutual render, only me for thee.</line>
      <line>Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul</line>
      <line>When most impeached, stands least in thy control.</line>
