    <stanza>
      <line>My love is as a fever longing <a>still</a></line>
      <line>For that which longer nurseth the <b>disease</b></line>
      <line>Feeding on that which doth preserve the <a>ill</a></line>
      <line>Th' uncertain sickly appetite to <b>please</b></line>
      <line>My reason the physician to my <c>love</c></line>
      <line>Angry that his prescriptions are not <d>kept</d></line>
      <line>Hath left me and I desperate now <c>approve</c></line>
      <line>Desire is death which physic did <d>except</d></line>
      <line>Past cure I am now reason is past <e>care</e></line>
      <line>And frantic-mad with evermore <f>unrest</f></line>
      <line>My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's <e>are</e></line>
      <line>At random from the truth vainly <f>expressed</f></line>
      <line>For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee <g>bright</g></line>
      <line>Who art as black as hell as dark as <g>night</g></line>
