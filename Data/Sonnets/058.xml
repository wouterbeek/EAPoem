    <stanza>
      <line>That god forbid, that made me first your slave,</line>
      <line>I should in thought control your times of pleasure,</line>
      <line>Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,</line>
      <line>Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.</line>
      <line>O let me suffer (being at your beck)</line>
      <line>Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,</line>
      <line>And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,</line>
      <line>Without accusing you of injury.</line>
      <line>Be where you list, your charter is so strong,</line>
      <line>That you your self may privilage your time</line>
      <line>To what you will, to you it doth belong,</line>
      <line>Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.</line>
      <line>I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,</line>
      <line>Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.</line>
