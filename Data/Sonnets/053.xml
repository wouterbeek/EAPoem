    <stanza>
      <line>What is your substance, whereof are you made,</line>
      <line>That millions of strange shadows on you tend?</line>
      <line>Since every one, hath every one, one shade,</line>
      <line>And you but one, can every shadow lend:</line>
      <line>Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,</line>
      <line>Is poorly imitated after you,</line>
      <line>On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,</line>
      <line>And you in Grecian tires are painted new:</line>
      <line>Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,</line>
      <line>The one doth shadow of your beauty show,</line>
      <line>The other as your bounty doth appear,</line>
      <line>And you in every blessed shape we know.</line>
      <line>In all external grace you have some part,</line>
      <line>But you like none, none you for constant heart.</line>
