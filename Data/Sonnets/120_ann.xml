    <stanza>
      <line>That you were once unkind befriends me (a)now(/a)</line>
      <line>And for that sorrow which I then did (b)feel(/b)</line>
      <line>Needs must I under my transgression (a)bow(/a)</line>
      <line>Unless my nerves were brass or hammered (b)steel(/b)</line>
      <line>For if you were by my unkindness (c)shaken(/c)</line>
      <line>As I by yours y'have passed a hell of (d)time(/d)</line>
      <line>And I a tyrant have no leisure (c)taken(/c)</line>
      <line>To weigh how once I suffered in your (d)crime(/d)</line>
      <line>O that our night of woe might have (e)remembered(/e)</line>
      <line>My deepest sense how hard true sorrow (f)hits(/f)</line>
      <line>And soon to you as you to me then (e)tendered(/e)</line>
      <line>The humble salve which wounded bosoms (f)fits(/f)</line>
      <line>But that your trespass now becomes a (g)fee(/g)</line>
      <line>Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom (g)me(/g)</line>
