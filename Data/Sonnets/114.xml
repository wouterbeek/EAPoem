    <stanza>
      <line>Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you</line>
      <line>Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?</line>
      <line>Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,</line>
      <line>And that your love taught it this alchemy?</line>
      <line>To make of monsters, and things indigest,</line>
      <line>Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</line>
      <line>Creating every bad a perfect best</line>
      <line>As fast as objects to his beams assemble:</line>
      <line>O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,</line>
      <line>And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,</line>
      <line>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,</line>
      <line>And to his palate doth prepare the cup.</line>
      <line>If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,</line>
      <line>That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</line>
