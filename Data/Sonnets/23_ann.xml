    <stanza>
      <line>As an unperfect actor on the <a>stage</a></line>
      <line>Who with his fear is put beside his <b>part</b></line>
      <line>Or some fierce thing replete with too much <a>rage</a></line>
      <line>Whose strength's abundance weakens his own <b>heart</b></line>
      <line>So I for fear of trust forget to <c>say</c></line>
      <line>The perfect ceremony of love's <d>rite</d></line>
      <line>And in mine own love's strength seem to <c>decay</c></line>
      <line>O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's <d>might</d></line>
      <line>O let my looks be then the <e>eloquence</e></line>
      <line>And dumb presagers of my speaking <f>breast</f></line>
      <line>Who plead for love and look for <e>recompense</e></line>
      <line>More than that tongue that more hath more <f>expressed</f></line>
      <line>O learn to read what silent love hath <g>writ</g></line>
      <line>To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine <g>wit</g></line>
