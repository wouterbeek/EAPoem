    <stanza>
      <line>O call not me to justify the wrong,</line>
      <line>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,</line>
      <line>Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,</line>
      <line>Use power with power, and slay me not by art,</line>
      <line>Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,</line>
      <line>Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,</line>
      <line>What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might</line>
      <line>Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?</line>
      <line>Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,</line>
      <line>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,</line>
      <line>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</line>
      <line>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</line>
      <line>Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,</line>
      <line>Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.</line>
