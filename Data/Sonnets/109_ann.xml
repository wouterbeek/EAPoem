    <stanza>
      <line>O never say that I was false of (a)heart(/a)</line>
      <line>Though absence seemed my flame to (b)qualify(/b)</line>
      <line>As easy might I from my self (a)depart(/a)</line>
      <line>As from my soul which in thy breast doth (b)lie(/b)</line>
      <line>That is my home of love if I have (c)ranged(/c)</line>
      <line>Like him that travels I return (d)again(/d)</line>
      <line>Just to the time not with the time (c)exchanged(/c)</line>
      <line>So that my self bring water for my (d)stain(/d)</line>
      <line>Never believe though in my nature (e)reigned(/e)</line>
      <line>All frailties that besiege all kinds of (f)blood(/f)</line>
      <line>That it could so preposterously be (e)stained(/e)</line>
      <line>To leave for nothing all thy sum of (f)good(/f)</line>
      <line>For nothing this wide universe I (g)call(/g)</line>
      <line>Save thou my rose in it thou art my (g)all(/g)</line>
