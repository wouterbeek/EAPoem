      <line>O lest the world should task you to (a)recite(/a)</line>
      <line>What merit lived in me that you should (b)love(/b)</line>
      <line>After my death (dear love) forget me (a)quite(/a)</line>
      <line>For you in me can nothing worthy (b)prove(/b)</line>
      <line>Unless you would devise some virtuous (c)lie(/c)</line>
      <line>To do more for me than mine own (d)desert(/d)</line>
      <line>And hang more praise upon deceased (c)I(/c)</line>
      <line>Than niggard truth would willingly (d)impart(/d)</line>
      <line>O lest your true love may seem false in (e)this(/e)</line>
      <line>That you for love speak well of me (f)untrue(/f)</line>
      <line>My name be buried where my body (e)is(/e)</line>
      <line>And live no more to shame nor me nor (f)you(/f)</line>
      <line>For I am shamed by that which I bring (g)forth(/g)</line>
      <line>And so should you to love things nothing (g)worth(/g)</line>
