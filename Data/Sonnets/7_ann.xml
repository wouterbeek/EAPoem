    <stanza>
      <line>Lo in the orient when the gracious <a>light</a></line>
      <line>Lifts up his burning head each under <b>eye</b></line>
      <line>Doth homage to his new-appearing <a>sight</a></line>
      <line>Serving with looks his sacred <b>majesty</b></line>
      <line>And having climbed the steep-up heavenly <c>hill</c></line>
      <line>Resembling strong youth in his middle <d>age</d></line>
      <line>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty <c>still</c></line>
      <line>Attending on his golden <d>pilgrimage</d></line>
      <line>But when from highmost pitch with weary <e>car</e></line>
      <line>Like feeble age he reeleth from the <f>day</f></line>
      <line>The eyes (fore duteous) now converted <e>are</e></line>
      <line>From his low tract and look another <f>way</f></line>
      <line>So thou thy self out-going in thy <g>noon</g></line>
      <line>Unlooked on diest unless thou get a <g>son</g></line>
