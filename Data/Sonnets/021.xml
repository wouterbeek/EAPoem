    <stanza>
      <line>So is it not with me as with that muse,</line>
      <line>Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,</line>
      <line>Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,</line>
      <line>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</line>
      <line>Making a couplement of proud compare</line>
      <line>With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:</line>
      <line>With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,</line>
      <line>That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</line>
      <line>O let me true in love but truly write,</line>
      <line>And then believe me, my love is as fair,</line>
      <line>As any mother's child, though not so bright</line>
      <line>As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:</line>
      <line>Let them say more that like of hearsay well,</line>
      <line>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</line>
