    <stanza>
      <line>My love is strengthened though more weak in <a>seeming</a></line>
      <line>I love not less though less the show <b>appear</b></line>
      <line>That love is merchandized whose rich <a>esteeming</a></line>
      <line>The owner's tongue doth publish every <b>where</b></line>
      <line>Our love was new and then but in the <c>spring</c></line>
      <line>When I was wont to greet it with my <d>lays</d></line>
      <line>As Philomel in summer's front doth <c>sing</c></line>
      <line>And stops her pipe in growth of riper <d>days</d></line>
      <line>Not that the summer is less pleasant <e>now</e></line>
      <line>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the <f>night</f></line>
      <line>But that wild music burthens every <e>bough</e></line>
      <line>And sweets grown common lose their dear <f>delight</f></line>
      <line>Therefore like her I sometime hold my <g>tongue</g></line>
      <line>Because I would not dull you with my <g>song</g></line>
