    <stanza>
      <line>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</line>
      <line>Admit impediments, love is not love</line>
      <line>Which alters when it alteration finds,</line>
      <line>Or bends with the remover to remove.</line>
      <line>O no, it is an ever-fixed mark</line>
      <line>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</line>
      <line>It is the star to every wand'ring bark,</line>
      <line>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</line>
      <line>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</line>
      <line>Within his bending sickle's compass come,</line>
      <line>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</line>
      <line>But bears it out even to the edge of doom:</line>
      <line>If this be error and upon me proved,</line>
      <line>I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</line>
