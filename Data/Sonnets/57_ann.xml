    <stanza>
      <line>Being your slave what should I do but (a)tend(/a)</line>
      <line>Upon the hours and times of your (b)desire(/b)</line>
      <line>I have no precious time at all to (a)spend(/a)</line>
      <line>Nor services to do till you (b)require(/b)</line>
      <line>Nor dare I chide the world-without-end (c)hour(/c)</line>
      <line>Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for (d)you(/d)</line>
      <line>Nor think the bitterness of absence (c)sour(/c)</line>
      <line>When you have bid your servant once (d)adieu(/d)</line>
      <line>Nor dare I question with my jealous (e)thought(/e)</line>
      <line>Where you may be or your affairs (f)suppose(/f)</line>
      <line>But like a sad slave stay and think of (e)nought(/e)</line>
      <line>Save where you are how happy you make (f)those(/f)</line>
      <line>So true a fool is love that in your (g)will(/g)</line>
      <line>(Though you do any thing) he thinks no (g)ill(/g)</line>
