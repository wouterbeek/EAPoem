      <line>They rightly do inherit heaven's (c)graces(/c)</line>
      <line>And husband nature's riches from (d)expense(/d)</line>

      <line>Though to it self it only live and (f)die(/f)</line>
      <line>But if that flower with base infection (e)meet(/e)</line>

      <line>Lilies that fester smell far worse than (g)weeds(/g)</line>
