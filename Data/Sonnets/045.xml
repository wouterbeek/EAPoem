    <stanza>
      <line>The other two slight air and purging fire</line>
      <line>Are both with thee wherever I abide</line>
      <line>The first my thought the other my desire</line>
      <line>These present-absent with swift motion slide</line>
      <line>For when these quicker elements are gone</line>
      <line>In tender embassy of love to thee</line>
      <line>My life being made of four with two alone</line>
      <line>Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy</line>
      <line>Until life's composition be recured</line>
      <line>By those swift messengers returned from thee</line>
      <line>Who even but now come back again assured</line>
      <line>Of thy fair health recounting it to me</line>
      <line>This told I joy but then no longer glad</line>
      <line>I send them back again and straight grow sad</line>
