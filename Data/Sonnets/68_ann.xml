    <stanza>
      <line>Thus is his cheek the map of days <a>outworn</a></line>
      <line>When beauty lived and died as flowers do <b>now</b></line>
      <line>Before these bastard signs of fair were <a>born</a></line>
      <line>Or durst inhabit on a living <b>brow</b></line>
      <line>Before the golden tresses of the <c>dead</c></line>
      <line>The right of sepulchres were shorn <d>away</d></line>
      <line>To live a second life on second <c>head</c></line>
      <line>Ere beauty's dead fleece made another <d>gay</d></line>
      <line>In him those holy antique hours are <e>seen</e></line>
      <line>Without all ornament it self and <f>true</f></line>
      <line>Making no summer of another's <e>green</e></line>
      <line>Robbing no old to dress his beauty <f>new</f></line>
      <line>And him as for a map doth Nature <g>store</g></line>
      <line>To show false Art what beauty was of <g>yore</g></line>
