    <stanza>
      <line>Alas 'tis true I have gone here and (a)there(/a)</line>
      <line>And made my self a motley to the (b)view(/b)</line>
      <line>Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most (a)dear(/a)</line>
      <line>Made old offences of affections (b)new(/b)</line>
      <line>Most true it is that I have looked on (c)truth(/c)</line>
      <line>Askance and strangely but by all (d)above(/d)</line>
      <line>These blenches gave my heart another (c)youth(/c)</line>
      <line>And worse essays proved thee my best of (d)love(/d)</line>
      <line>Now all is done have what shall have no (e)end(/e)</line>
      <line>Mine appetite I never more will (f)grind(/f)</line>
      <line>On newer proof to try an older (e)friend(/e)</line>
      <line>A god in love to whom I am (f)confined(/f)</line>
      <line>Then give me welcome next my heaven the (g)best(/g)</line>
      <line>Even to thy pure and most most loving (g)breast(/g)</line>
