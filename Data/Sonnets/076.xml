    <stanza>
      <line>Why is my verse so barren of new pride?</line>
      <line>So far from variation or quick change?</line>
      <line>Why with the time do I not glance aside</line>
      <line>To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?</line>
      <line>Why write I still all one, ever the same,</line>
      <line>And keep invention in a noted weed,</line>
      <line>That every word doth almost tell my name,</line>
      <line>Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?</line>
      <line>O know sweet love I always write of you,</line>
      <line>And you and love are still my argument:</line>
      <line>So all my best is dressing old words new,</line>
      <line>Spending again what is already spent:</line>
      <line>For as the sun is daily new and old,</line>
      <line>So is my love still telling what is told.</line>
