    <stanza>
      <line>If there be nothing new, but that which is,</line>
      <line>Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,</line>
      <line>Which labouring for invention bear amis</line>
      <line>The second burthen of a former child!</line>
      <line>O that record could with a backward look,</line>
      <line>Even of five hundred courses of the sun,</line>
      <line>Show me your image in some antique book,</line>
      <line>Since mind at first in character was done.</line>
      <line>That I might see what the old world could say,</line>
      <line>To this composed wonder of your frame,</line>
      <line>Whether we are mended, or whether better they,</line>
      <line>Or whether revolution be the same.</line>
      <line>O sure I am the wits of former days,</line>
      <line>To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</line>
