    <stanza>
      <line>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,</line>
      <line>I summon up remembrance of things past,</line>
      <line>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</line>
      <line>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:</line>
      <line>Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)</line>
      <line>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</line>
      <line>And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,</line>
      <line>And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.</line>
      <line>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</line>
      <line>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</line>
      <line>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</line>
      <line>Which I new pay as if not paid before.</line>
      <line>But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)</line>
      <line>All losses are restored, and sorrows end.</line>
