    <stanza>
      <line>Let those who are in favour with their stars</line>
      <line>Of public honour and proud titles boast</line>
      <line>Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars</line>
      <line>Unlooked for joy in that I honour most</line>
      <line>Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread</line>
      <line>But as the marigold at the sun's eye</line>
      <line>And in themselves their pride lies buried</line>
      <line>For at a frown they in their glory die</line>
      <line>The painful warrior famoused for fight</line>
      <line>After a thousand victories once foiled</line>
      <line>Is from the book of honour razed quite</line>
      <line>And all the rest forgot for which he toiled</line>
      <line>Then happy I that love and am beloved</line>
      <line>Where I may not remove nor be removed</line>
    </stanza>
