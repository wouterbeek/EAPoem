      <line>Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine (a)eyes(/a)</line>
      <line>That they behold and see not what they (b)see(/b)</line>
      <line>They know what beauty is see where it (a)lies(/a)</line>
      <line>Yet what the best is take the worst to (b)be(/b)</line>
      <line>If eyes corrupt by over-partial (c)looks(/c)</line>
      <line>Be anchored in the bay where all men (d)ride(/d)</line>
      <line>Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged (c)hooks(/c)</line>
      <line>Whereto the judgment of my heart is (d)tied(/d)</line>
      <line>Why should my heart think that a several (e)plot(/e)</line>
      <line>Which my heart knows the wide world's common (f)place(/f)</line>
      <line>Or mine eyes seeing this say this is (e)not(/e)</line>
      <line>To put fair truth upon so foul a (f)face(/f)</line>
      <line>In things right true my heart and eyes have (g)erred(/g)</line>
      <line>And to this false plague are they now (g)transferred(/g)</line>
