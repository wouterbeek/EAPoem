    <stanza>
      <line>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,</line>
      <line>Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,</line>
      <line>Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,</line>
      <line>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</line>
      <line>All men make faults, and even I in this,</line>
      <line>Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</line>
      <line>My self corrupting salving thy amiss,</line>
      <line>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:</line>
      <line>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,</line>
      <line>Thy adverse party is thy advocate,</line>
      <line>And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:</line>
      <line>Such civil war is in my love and hate,</line>
      <line>That I an accessary needs must be,</line>
      <line>To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</line>
