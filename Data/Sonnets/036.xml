    <stanza>
      <line>Let me confess that we two must be twain,</line>
      <line>Although our undivided loves are one:</line>
      <line>So shall those blots that do with me remain,</line>
      <line>Without thy help, by me be borne alone.</line>
      <line>In our two loves there is but one respect,</line>
      <line>Though in our lives a separable spite,</line>
      <line>Which though it alter not love's sole effect,</line>
      <line>Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.</line>
      <line>I may not evermore acknowledge thee,</line>
      <line>Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,</line>
      <line>Nor thou with public kindness honour me,</line>
      <line>Unless thou take that honour from thy name:</line>
      <line>But do not so, I love thee in such sort,</line>
      <line>As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</line>
