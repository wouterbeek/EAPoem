    <stanza>
      <line>Against that time (if ever that time (a)come)(/a)</line>
      <line>When I shall see thee frown on my (b)defects(/b)</line>
      <line>When as thy love hath cast his utmost (a)sum(/a)</line>
      <line>Called to that audit by advised (b)respects(/b)</line>
      <line>Against that time when thou shalt strangely (c)pass(/c)</line>
      <line>And scarcely greet me with that sun thine (d)eye(/d)</line>
      <line>When love converted from the thing it (c)was(/c)</line>
      <line>Shall reasons find of settled (d)gravity(/d)</line>
      <line>Against that time do I ensconce me (e)here(/e)</line>
      <line>Within the knowledge of mine own (f)desert(/f)</line>
      <line>And this my hand against my self (e)uprear(/e)</line>
      <line>To guard the lawful reasons on thy (f)part(/f)</line>
      <line>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of (g)laws(/g)</line>
      <line>Since why to love I can allege no (g)cause(/g)</line>
