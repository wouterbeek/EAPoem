    <stanza>
      <line>The little Love-god lying once asleep,</line>
      <line>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</line>
      <line>Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,</line>
      <line>Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,</line>
      <line>The fairest votary took up that fire,</line>
      <line>Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,</line>
      <line>And so the general of hot desire,</line>
      <line>Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.</line>
      <line>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</line>
      <line>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,</line>
      <line>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,</line>
      <line>For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,</line>
      <line>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,</line>
      <line>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.</line>
