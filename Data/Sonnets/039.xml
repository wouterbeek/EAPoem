    <stanza>
      <line>O how thy worth with manners may I sing,</line>
      <line>When thou art all the better part of me?</line>
      <line>What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:</line>
      <line>And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?</line>
      <line>Even for this, let us divided live,</line>
      <line>And our dear love lose name of single one,</line>
      <line>That by this separation I may give:</line>
      <line>That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:</line>
      <line>O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,</line>
      <line>Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,</line>
      <line>To entertain the time with thoughts of love,</line>
      <line>Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.</line>
      <line>And that thou teachest how to make one twain,</line>
      <line>By praising him here who doth hence remain.</line>
