    <stanza>
      <line>When in the chronicle of wasted <a>time</a></line>
      <line>I see descriptions of the fairest <b>wights</b></line>
      <line>And beauty making beautiful old <a>rhyme</a></line>
      <line>In praise of ladies dead and lovely <b>knights</b></line>
      <line>Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's <c>best</c></line>
      <line>Of hand of foot of lip of eye of <d>brow</d></line>
      <line>I see their antique pen would have <c>expressed</c></line>
      <line>Even such a beauty as you master <d>now</d></line>
      <line>So all their praises are but <e>prophecies</e></line>
      <line>Of this our time all you <f>prefiguring</f></line>
      <line>And for they looked but with divining <e>eyes</e></line>
      <line>They had not skill enough your worth to <f>sing</f></line>
      <line>For we which now behold these present <g>days</g></line>
      <line>Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to <g>praise</g></line>
