    <stanza>
      <line>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</line>
      <line>Like a deceived husband, so love's face,</line>
      <line>May still seem love to me, though altered new:</line>
      <line>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.</line>
      <line>For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</line>
      <line>Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,</line>
      <line>In many's looks, the false heart's history</line>
      <line>Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.</line>
      <line>But heaven in thy creation did decree,</line>
      <line>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,</line>
      <line>Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,</line>
      <line>Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.</line>
      <line>How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</line>
      <line>If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; </line>
