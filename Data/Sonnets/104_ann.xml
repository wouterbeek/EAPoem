    <stanza>
      <line>To me fair friend you never can be (a)old(/a)</line>
      <line>For as you were when first your eye I (b)eyed(/b)</line>
      <line>Such seems your beauty still three winters (a)cold(/a)</line>
      <line>Have from the forests shook three summers' (b)pride(/b)</line>
      <line>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn (c)turned(/c)</line>
      <line>In process of the seasons have I (d)seen(/d)</line>
      <line>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes (c)burned(/c)</line>
      <line>Since first I saw you fresh which yet are (d)green(/d)</line>
      <line>Ah yet doth beauty like a dial (e)hand(/e)</line>
      <line>Steal from his figure and no pace (f)perceived(/f)</line>
      <line>So your sweet hue which methinks still doth (e)stand(/e)</line>
      <line>Hath motion and mine eye may be (f)deceived(/f)</line>
      <line>For fear of which hear this thou age (g)unbred(/g)</line>
      <line>Ere you were born was beauty's summer (g)dead(/g)</line>
