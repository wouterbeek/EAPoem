    <stanza>
      <line>Alack what poverty my muse brings forth</line>
      <line>That having such a scope to show her pride</line>
      <line>The argument all bare is of more worth</line>
      <line>Than when it hath my added praise beside</line>
      <line>O blame me not if I no more can write</line>
      <line>Look in your glass and there appears a face</line>
      <line>That over-goes my blunt invention quite</line>
      <line>Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace</line>
      <line>Were it not sinful then striving to mend</line>
      <line>To mar the subject that before was well</line>
      <line>For to no other pass my verses tend</line>
      <line>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell</line>
      <line>And more much more than in my verse can sit</line>
      <line>Your own glass shows you when you look in it</line>
