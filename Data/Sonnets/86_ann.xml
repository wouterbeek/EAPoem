    <stanza>
      <line>Was it the proud full sail of his great <a>verse</a></line>
      <line>Bound for the prize of (all too precious) <b>you</b></line>
      <line>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain <a>inhearse</a></line>
      <line>Making their tomb the womb wherein they <b>grew</b></line>
      <line>Was it his spirit by spirits taught to <c>write</c></line>
      <line>Above a mortal pitch that struck me <d>dead</d></line>
      <line>No neither he nor his compeers by <c>night</c></line>
      <line>Giving him aid my verse <d>astonished</d></line>
      <line>He nor that affable familiar <e>ghost</e></line>
      <line>Which nightly gulls him with <f>intelligence</f></line>
      <line>As victors of my silence cannot <e>boast</e></line>
      <line>I was not sick of any fear from <f>thence</f></line>
      <line>But when your countenance filled up his <g>line</g></line>
      <line>Then lacked I matter that enfeebled <g>mine</g></line>
