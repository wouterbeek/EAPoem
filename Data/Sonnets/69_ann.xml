    <stanza>
      <line>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth <a>view</a></line>
      <line>Want nothing that the thought of hearts can <b>mend</b></line>
      <line>All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that <a>due</a></line>
      <line>Uttering bare truth even so as foes <b>commend</b></line>
      <line>Thy outward thus with outward praise is <c>crowned</c></line>
      <line>But those same tongues that give thee so thine <d>own</d></line>
      <line>In other accents do this praise <c>confound</c></line>
      <line>By seeing farther than the eye hath <d>shown</d></line>
      <line>They look into the beauty of thy <e>mind</e></line>
      <line>And that in guess they measure by thy <f>deeds</f></line>
      <line>Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were <e>kind)</e></line>
      <line>To thy fair flower add the rank smell of <f>weeds</f></line>
      <line>But why thy odour matcheth not thy <g>show</g></line>
      <line>The soil is this that thou dost common <g>grow</g></line>
