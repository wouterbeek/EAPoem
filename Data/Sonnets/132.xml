    <stanza>
      <line>Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,</line>
      <line>Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,</line>
      <line>Have put on black, and loving mourners be,</line>
      <line>Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.</line>
      <line>And truly not the morning sun of heaven</line>
      <line>Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,</line>
      <line>Nor that full star that ushers in the even</line>
      <line>Doth half that glory to the sober west</line>
      <line>As those two mourning eyes become thy face:</line>
      <line>O let it then as well beseem thy heart</line>
      <line>To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,</line>
      <line>And suit thy pity like in every part.</line>
      <line>Then will I swear beauty herself is black,</line>
      <line>And all they foul that thy complexion lack.</line>
