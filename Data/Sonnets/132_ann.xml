    <stanza>
      <line>Thine eyes I love and they as pitying (a)me(/a)</line>
      <line>Knowing thy heart torment me with (b)disdain(/b)</line>
      <line>Have put on black and loving mourners (a)be(/a)</line>
      <line>Looking with pretty ruth upon my (b)pain(/b)</line>
      <line>And truly not the morning sun of (c)heaven(/c)</line>
      <line>Better becomes the grey cheeks of the (d)east(/d)</line>
      <line>Nor that full star that ushers in the (c)even(/c)</line>
      <line>Doth half that glory to the sober (d)west(/d)</line>
      <line>As those two mourning eyes become thy (e)face(/e)</line>
      <line>O let it then as well beseem thy (f)heart(/f)</line>
      <line>To mourn for me since mourning doth thee (e)grace(/e)</line>
      <line>And suit thy pity like in every (f)part(/f)</line>
      <line>Then will I swear beauty herself is (g)black(/g)</line>
      <line>And all they foul that thy complexion (g)lack(/g)</line>
