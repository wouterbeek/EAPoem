    <stanza>
      <line>Let not my love be called idolatry,</line>
      <line>Nor my beloved as an idol show,</line>
      <line>Since all alike my songs and praises be</line>
      <line>To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</line>
      <line>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</line>
      <line>Still constant in a wondrous excellence,</line>
      <line>Therefore my verse to constancy confined,</line>
      <line>One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</line>
      <line>Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,</line>
      <line>Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,</line>
      <line>And in this change is my invention spent,</line>
      <line>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</line>
      <line>Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.</line>
      <line>Which three till now, never kept seat in one.</line>
