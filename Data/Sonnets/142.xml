    <stanza>
      <line>Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate</line>
      <line>Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving</line>
      <line>O but with mine compare thou thine own state</line>
      <line>And thou shalt find it merits not reproving</line>
      <line>Or if it do not from those lips of thine</line>
      <line>That have profaned their scarlet ornaments</line>
      <line>And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine</line>
      <line>Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents</line>
      <line>Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those</line>
      <line>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee</line>
      <line>Root pity in thy heart that when it grows</line>
      <line>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be</line>
      <line>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide</line>
      <line>By self-example mayst thou be denied</line>
