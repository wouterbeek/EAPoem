      <line>Some glory in their birth some in their (a)skill(/a)</line>
      <line>Some in their wealth some in their body's (b)force(/b)</line>
      <line>Some in their garments though new-fangled (a)ill(/a)</line>
      <line>Some in their hawks and hounds some in their (b)horse(/b)</line>
      <line>And every humour hath his adjunct (c)pleasure(/c)</line>
      <line>Wherein it finds a joy above the (d)rest(/d)</line>
      <line>But these particulars are not my (c)measure(/c)</line>
      <line>All these I better in one general (d)best(/d)</line>
      <line>Thy love is better than high birth to (e)me(/e)</line>
      <line>Richer than wealth prouder than garments' (f)costs(/f)</line>
      <line>Of more delight than hawks and horses (e)be(/e)</line>
      <line>And having thee of all men's pride I (f)boast(/f)</line>
      <line>Wretched in this alone that thou mayst (g)take(/g)</line>
      <line>All this away and me most wretchcd (g)make(/g)</line>
