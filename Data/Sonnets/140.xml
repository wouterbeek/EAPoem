    <stanza>
      <line>Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press</line>
      <line>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:</line>
      <line>Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,</line>
      <line>The manner of my pity-wanting pain.</line>
      <line>If I might teach thee wit better it were,</line>
      <line>Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,</line>
      <line>As testy sick men when their deaths be near,</line>
      <line>No news but health from their physicians know.</line>
      <line>For if I should despair I should grow mad,</line>
      <line>And in my madness might speak ill of thee,</line>
      <line>Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,</line>
      <line>Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.</line>
      <line>That I may not be so, nor thou belied,</line>
      <line>Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</line>
