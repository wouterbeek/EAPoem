    <stanza>
      <line>When in the chronicle of wasted time</line>
      <line>I see descriptions of the fairest wights</line>
      <line>And beauty making beautiful old rhyme</line>
      <line>In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights</line>
      <line>Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best</line>
      <line>Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow</line>
      <line>I see their antique pen would have expressed</line>
      <line>Even such a beauty as you master now</line>
      <line>So all their praises are but prophecies</line>
      <line>Of this our time all you prefiguring</line>
      <line>And for they looked but with divining eyes</line>
      <line>They had not skill enough your worth to sing</line>
      <line>For we which now behold these present days</line>
      <line>Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise</line>
