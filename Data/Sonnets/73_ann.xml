    <stanza>
      <line>That time of year thou mayst in me (a)behold(/a)</line>
      <line>When yellow leaves or none or few do (b)hang(/b)</line>
      <line>Upon those boughs which shake against the (a)cold(/a)</line>
      <line>Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds (b)sang(/b)</line>
      <line>In me thou seest the twilight of such (c)day(/c)</line>
      <line>As after sunset fadeth in the (d)west(/d)</line>
      <line>Which by and by black night doth take (c)away(/c)</line>
      <line>Death's second self that seals up all in (d)rest(/d)</line>
      <line>In me thou seest the glowing of such (e)fire(/e)</line>
      <line>That on the ashes of his youth doth (f)lie(/f)</line>
      <line>As the death-bed whereon it must (e)expire(/e)</line>
      <line>Consumed with that which it was nourished (f)by(/f)</line>
      <line>This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more (g)strong(/g)</line>
      <line>To love that well which thou must leave ere (g)long(/g)</line>
