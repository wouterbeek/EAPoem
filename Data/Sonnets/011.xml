    <stanza>
      <line>As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,</line>
      <line>In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</line>
      <line>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,</line>
      <line>Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,</line>
      <line>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</line>
      <line>Without this folly, age, and cold decay,</line>
      <line>If all were minded so, the times should cease,</line>
      <line>And threescore year would make the world away:</line>
      <line>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</line>
      <line>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</line>
      <line>Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;</line>
      <line>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</line>
      <line>She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</line>
      <line>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</line>
