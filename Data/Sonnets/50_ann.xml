    <stanza>
      <line>How heavy do I journey on the (a)way(/a)</line>
      <line>When what I seek (my weary travel's (b)end)(/b)</line>
      <line>Doth teach that case and that repose to (a)say(/a)</line>
      <line>'Thus far the miles are measured from thy (b)friend'(/b)</line>
      <line>The beast that bears me tired with my (c)woe(/c)</line>
      <line>Plods dully on to bear that weight in (d)me(/d)</line>
      <line>As if by some instinct the wretch did (c)know(/c)</line>
      <line>His rider loved not speed being made from (d)thee(/d)</line>
      <line>The bloody spur cannot provoke him (e)on(/e)</line>
      <line>That sometimes anger thrusts into his (f)hide(/f)</line>
      <line>Which heavily he answers with a (e)groan(/e)</line>
      <line>More sharp to me than spurring to his (f)side(/f)</line>
      <line>For that same groan doth put this in my (g)mind(/g)</line>
      <line>My grief lies onward and my joy (g)behind(/g)</line>
