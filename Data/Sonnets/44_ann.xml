    <stanza>
      <line>If the dull substance of my flesh were (a)thought(/a)</line>
      <line>Injurious distance should not stop my (b)way(/b)</line>
      <line>For then despite of space I would be (a)brought(/a)</line>
      <line>From limits far remote where thou dost (b)stay(/b)</line>
      <line>No matter then although my foot did (c)stand(/c)</line>
      <line>Upon the farthest earth removed from (d)thee(/d)</line>
      <line>For nimble thought can jump both sea and (c)land(/c)</line>
      <line>As soon as think the place where he would (d)be(/d)</line>
      <line>But ah thought kills me that I am not (e)thought(/e)</line>
      <line>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art (f)gone(/f)</line>
      <line>But that so much of earth and water (e)wrought(/e)</line>
      <line>I must attend time's leisure with my (f)moan(/f)</line>
      <line>Receiving nought by elements so (g)slow(/g)</line>
      <line>But heavy tears badges of either's (g)woe(/g)</line>
