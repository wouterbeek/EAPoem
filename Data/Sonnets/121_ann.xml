      <line>'Tis better to be vile than vile (a)esteemed(/a)</line>
      <line>When not to be receives reproach of (b)being(/b)</line>
      <line>And the just pleasure lost which is so (a)deemed(/a)</line>
      <line>Not by our feeling but by others' (b)seeing(/b)</line>
      <line>For why should others' false adulterate (c)eyes(/c)</line>
      <line>Give salutation to my sportive (d)blood(/d)</line>
      <line>Or on my frailties why are frailer (c)spies(/c)</line>
      <line>Which in their wills count bad what I think (d)good(/d)</line>
      <line>No I am that I am and they that (e)level(/e)</line>

      <line>I may be straight though they themselves be (e)bevel(/e)</line>
      <line>By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be (f)shown(/f)</line>

      <line>All men are bad and in their badness (g)reign(/g)</line>
