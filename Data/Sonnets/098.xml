    <stanza>
      <line>From you have I been absent in the spring</line>
      <line>When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)</line>
      <line>Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing</line>
      <line>That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him</line>
      <line>Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell</line>
      <line>Of different flowers in odour and in hue</line>
      <line>Could make me any summer's story tell</line>
      <line>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew</line>
      <line>Nor did I wonder at the lily's white</line>
      <line>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose</line>
      <line>They were but sweet but figures of delight</line>
      <line>Drawn after you you pattern of all those</line>
      <line>Yet seemed it winter still and you away</line>
      <line>As with your shadow I with these did play</line>
    </stanza>
