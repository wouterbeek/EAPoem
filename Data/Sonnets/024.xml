    <stanza>
      <line>Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled</line>
      <line>Thy beauty's form in table of my heart</line>
      <line>My body is the frame wherein 'tis held</line>
      <line>And perspective it is best painter's art</line>
      <line>For through the painter must you see his skill</line>
      <line>To find where your true image pictured lies</line>
      <line>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still</line>
      <line>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes</line>
      <line>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done</line>
      <line>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me</line>
      <line>Are windows to my breast where-through the sun</line>
      <line>Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee</line>
      <line>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art</line>
      <line>They draw but what they see know not the heart</line>
