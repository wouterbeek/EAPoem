    <stanza>
      <line>The forward violet thus did I (a)chide(/a)</line>
      <line>Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that (b)smells(/b)</line>
      <line>If not from my love's breath The purple (a)pride(/a)</line>
      <line>Which on thy soft check for complexion (b)dwells(/b)</line>
      <line>In my love's veins thou hast too grossly (c)dyed(/c)</line>
      <line>The lily I condemned for thy (d)hand(/d)</line>
      <line>And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy (c)hair(/c)</line>
      <line>The roses fearfully on thorns did (d)stand(/d)</line>
      <line>One blushing shame another white (e)despair(/e)</line>
      <line>A third nor red nor white had stol'n of (f)both(/f)</line>
      <line>And to his robbery had annexed thy (e)breath(/e)</line>
      <line>But for his theft in pride of all his (f)growth(/f)</line>
      <line>A vengeful canker eat him up to (g)death(/g)</line>
      <line>More flowers I noted yet I none could (g)see(/g)</line>
      <line>But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee</line>
