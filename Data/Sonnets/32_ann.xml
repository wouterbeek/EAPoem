    <stanza>
      <line>If thou survive my well-contented <a>day</a></line>
      <line>When that churl death my bones with dust shall <b>cover</b></line>
      <line>And shalt by fortune once more <a>re-survey</a></line>
      <line>These poor rude lines of thy deceased <b>lover</b></line>
      <line>Compare them with the bett'ring of the <c>time</c></line>
      <line>And though they be outstripped by every <d>pen</d></line>
      <line>Reserve them for my love not for their <c>rhyme</c></line>
      <line>Exceeded by the height of happier <d>men</d></line>
      <line>O then vouchsafe me but this loving <e>thought</e></line>
      <line>'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing <f>age</f></line>
      <line>A dearer birth than this his love had <e>brought</e></line>
      <line>To march in ranks of better <f>equipage</f></line>
      <line>But since he died and poets better <g>prove</g></line>
      <line>Theirs for their style I'll read his for his <g>love'</g></line>
