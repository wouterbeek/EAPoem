    <stanza>
      <line>Lo as a careful huswife runs to (a)catch(/a)</line>
      <line>One of her feathered creatures broke (b)away(/b)</line>
      <line>Sets down her babe and makes all swift (a)dispatch(/a)</line>
      <line>In pursuit of the thing she would have (b)stay(/b)</line>
      <line>Whilst her neglected child holds her in (c)chase(/c)</line>
      <line>Cries to catch her whose busy care is (d)bent(/d)</line>
      <line>To follow that which flies before her (c)face(/c)</line>
      <line>Not prizing her poor infant's (d)discontent(/d)</line>
      <line>So run'st thou after that which flies from (e)thee(/e)</line>
      <line>Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar (f)behind(/f)</line>
      <line>But if thou catch thy hope turn back to (e)me(/e)</line>
      <line>And play the mother's part kiss me be (f)kind(/f)</line>
      <line>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy (g)Will(/g)</line>
      <line>If thou turn back and my loud crying (g)still(/g)</line>
