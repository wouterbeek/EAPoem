    <stanza>
      <line>When my love swears that she is made of <a>truth</a></line>
      <line>I do believe her though I know she <b>lies</b></line>
      <line>That she might think me some untutored <a>youth</a></line>
      <line>Unlearned in the world's false <b>subtleties</b></line>
      <line>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me <c>young</c></line>
      <line>Although she knows my days are past the <d>best</d></line>
      <line>Simply I credit her false-speaking <c>tongue</c></line>
      <line>On both sides thus is simple truth <d>suppressed</d></line>
      <line>But wherefore says she not she is <e>unjust</e></line>
      <line>And wherefore say not I that I am <f>old</f></line>
      <line>O love's best habit is in seeming <e>trust</e></line>
      <line>And age in love loves not to have years <f>told</f></line>
      <line>Therefore I lie with her and she with <g>me</g></line>
      <line>And in our faults by lies we flattered <g>be</g></line>
