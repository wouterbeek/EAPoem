    <stanza>
      <line>How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,</line>
      <line>Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds</line>
      <line>With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st</line>
      <line>The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,</line>
      <line>Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,</line>
      <line>To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,</line>
      <line>Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,</line>
      <line>At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.</line>
      <line>To be so tickled they would change their state</line>
      <line>And situation with those dancing chips,</line>
      <line>O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,</line>
      <line>Making dead wood more blest than living lips,</line>
      <line>Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,</line>
      <line>Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.</line>
