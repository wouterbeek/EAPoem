    <stanza>
      <line>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain</line>
      <line>Full charactered with lasting memory,</line>
      <line>Which shall above that idle rank remain</line>
      <line>Beyond all date even to eternity.</line>
      <line>Or at the least, so long as brain and heart</line>
      <line>Have faculty by nature to subsist,</line>
      <line>Till each to razed oblivion yield his part</line>
      <line>Of thee, thy record never can be missed:</line>
      <line>That poor retention could not so much hold,</line>
      <line>Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,</line>
      <line>Therefore to give them from me was I bold,</line>
      <line>To trust those tables that receive thee more:</line>
      <line>To keep an adjunct to remember thee</line>
      <line>Were to import forgetfulness in me.</line>
