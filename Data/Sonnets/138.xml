    <stanza>
      <line>When my love swears that she is made of truth,</line>
      <line>I do believe her, though I know she lies,</line>
      <line>That she might think me some untutored youth,</line>
      <line>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</line>
      <line>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</line>
      <line>Although she knows my days are past the best,</line>
      <line>Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,</line>
      <line>On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:</line>
      <line>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</line>
      <line>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</line>
      <line>O love's best habit is in seeming trust,</line>
      <line>And age in love, loves not to have years told.</line>
      <line>Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,</line>
      <line>And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</line>
