    <stanza>
      <line>The little Love-god lying once <a>asleep</a></line>
      <line>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming <b>brand</b></line>
      <line>Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to <a>keep</a></line>
      <line>Came tripping by but in her maiden <b>hand</b></line>
      <line>The fairest votary took up that <c>fire</c></line>
      <line>Which many legions of true hearts had <d>warmed</d></line>
      <line>And so the general of hot <c>desire</c></line>
      <line>Was sleeping by a virgin hand <d>disarmed</d></line>
      <line>This brand she quenched in a cool well <e>by</e></line>
      <line>Which from Love's fire took heat <f>perpetual</f></line>
      <line>Growing a bath and healthful <e>remedy</e></line>
      <line>For men discased but I my mistress' <f>thrall</f></line>
      <line>Came there for cure and this by that I <g>prove</g></line>
      <line>Love's fire heats water water cools not <g>love</g></line>
