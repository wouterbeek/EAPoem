    <stanza>
      <line>O how I faint when I of you do (a)write(/a)</line>
      <line>Knowing a better spirit doth use your (b)name(/b)</line>
      <line>And in the praise thereof spends all his (a)might(/a)</line>
      <line>To make me tongue-tied speaking of your (b)fame(/b)</line>
      <line>But since your worth (wide as the ocean (c)is)(/c)</line>
      <line>The humble as the proudest sail doth (d)bear(/d)</line>
      <line>My saucy bark (inferior far to (c)his)(/c)</line>
      <line>On your broad main doth wilfully (d)appear(/d)</line>
      <line>Your shallowest help will hold me up (e)afloat(/e)</line>
      <line>Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth (f)ride(/f)</line>
      <line>Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless (e)boat(/e)</line>
      <line>He of tall building and of goodly (f)pride(/f)</line>
      <line>Then if he thrive and I be cast (g)away(/g)</line>
      <line>The worst was this my love was my (g)decay(/g)</line>
