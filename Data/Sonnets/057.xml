    <stanza>
      <line>Being your slave what should I do but tend</line>
      <line>Upon the hours and times of your desire</line>
      <line>I have no precious time at all to spend</line>
      <line>Nor services to do till you require</line>
      <line>Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour</line>
      <line>Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you</line>
      <line>Nor think the bitterness of absence sour</line>
      <line>When you have bid your servant once adieu</line>
      <line>Nor dare I question with my jealous thought</line>
      <line>Where you may be or your affairs suppose</line>
      <line>But like a sad slave stay and think of nought</line>
      <line>Save where you are how happy you make those</line>
      <line>So true a fool is love that in your will</line>
      <line>(Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill</line>
