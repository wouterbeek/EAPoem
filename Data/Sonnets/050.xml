    <stanza>
      <line>How heavy do I journey on the way</line>
      <line>When what I seek my weary travel end</line>
      <line>Doth teach that case and that repose to say</line>
      <line>Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend</line>
      <line>The beast that bears me tired with my woe</line>
      <line>Plods dully on to bear that weight in me</line>
      <line>As if by some instinct the wretch did know</line>
      <line>His rider loved not speed being made from thee</line>
      <line>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on</line>
      <line>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide</line>
      <line>Which heavily he answers with a groan</line>
      <line>More sharp to me than spurring to his side</line>
      <line>For that same groan doth put this in my mind</line>
      <line>My grief lies onward and my joy behind</line>
