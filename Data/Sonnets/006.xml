    <stanza>
      <line>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,</line>
      <line>In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:</line>
      <line>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,</line>
      <line>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:</line>
      <line>That use is not forbidden usury,</line>
      <line>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</line>
      <line>That's for thy self to breed another thee,</line>
      <line>Or ten times happier be it ten for one,</line>
      <line>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,</line>
      <line>If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:</line>
      <line>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</line>
      <line>Leaving thee living in posterity?</line>
      <line>Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,</line>
      <line>To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</line>
