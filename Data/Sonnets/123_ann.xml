    <stanza>
      <line>No Time thou shalt not boast that I do (a)change(/a)</line>
      <line>Thy pyramids built up with newer (b)might(/b)</line>
      <line>To me are nothing novel nothing (a)strange(/a)</line>
      <line>They are but dressings Of a former (b)sight(/b)</line>
      <line>Our dates are brief and therefore we (c)admire(/c)</line>
      <line>What thou dost foist upon us that is (d)old(/d)</line>
      <line>And rather make them born to our (c)desire(/c)</line>
      <line>Than think that we before have heard them (d)told(/d)</line>
      <line>Thy registers and thee I both (e)defy(/e)</line>
      <line>Not wond'ring at the present nor the (f)past(/f)</line>
      <line>For thy records and what we see doth (e)lie(/e)</line>
      <line>Made more or less by thy continual (f)haste(/f)</line>
      <line>This I do vow and this shall ever (g)be(/g)</line>
      <line>I will be true despite thy scythe and (g)thee(/g)</line>
