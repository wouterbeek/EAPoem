    <stanza>
      <line>Full many a glorious morning have I (a)seen(/a)</line>
      <line>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign (b)eye(/b)</line>
      <line>Kissing with golden face the meadows (a)green(/a)</line>
      <line>Gilding pale streams with heavenly (b)alchemy(/b)</line>
      <line>Anon permit the basest clouds to (c)ride(/c)</line>
      <line>With ugly rack on his celestial (d)face(/d)</line>
      <line>And from the forlorn world his visage (c)hide(/c)</line>
      <line>Stealing unseen to west with this (d)disgrace(/d)</line>
      <line>Even so my sun one early morn did (e)shine(/e)</line>
      <line>With all triumphant splendour on my (f)brow(/f)</line>
      <line>But out alack he was but one hour (e)mine(/e)</line>
      <line>The region cloud hath masked him from me (f)now(/f)</line>
      <line>Yet him for this my love no whit (g)disdaineth(/g)</line>
      <line>Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun (g)staineth(/g)</line>
