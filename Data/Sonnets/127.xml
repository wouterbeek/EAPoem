    <stanza>
      <line>In the old age black was not counted fair,</line>
      <line>Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:</line>
      <line>But now is black beauty's successive heir,</line>
      <line>And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,</line>
      <line>For since each hand hath put on nature's power,</line>
      <line>Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,</line>
      <line>Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,</line>
      <line>But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.</line>
      <line>Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,</line>
      <line>Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,</line>
      <line>At such who not born fair no beauty lack,</line>
      <line>Slandering creation with a false esteem,</line>
      <line>Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,</line>
      <line>That every tongue says beauty should look so.</line>
