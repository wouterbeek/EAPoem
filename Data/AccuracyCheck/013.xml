    <stanza>
      <line>O that you were your self but love you are</line>
      <line>No longer yours than you your self here live</line>
      <line>Against this coming end you should prepare</line>
      <line>And your sweet semblance to some other give</line>
      <line>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</line>
      <line>Find no determination then you were</line>
      <line>Your self again after your self decease</line>
      <line>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear</line>
      <line>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay</line>
      <line>Which husbandry in honour might uphold</line>
      <line>Against the stormy gusts of winter day</line>
      <line>And barren rage of death eternal cold</line>
      <line>O none but unthrifts dear my love you know</line>
      <line>You had a father let your son say so</line>
