    <stanza>
      <line>Like as to make our appetite more keen</line>
      <line>With eager compounds we our palate urge</line>
      <line>As to prevent our maladies unseen</line>
      <line>We sicken to shun sickness when we purge</line>
      <line>Even so being full of your neer cloying sweetness</line>
      <line>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding</line>
      <line>And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness</line>
      <line>To be diseased ere that there was true needing</line>
      <line>Thus policy in love t anticipate</line>
      <line>The ills that were not grew to faults assured</line>
      <line>And brought to medicine a healthful state</line>
      <line>Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured</line>
      <line>But thence I learn and find the lesson true</line>
      <line>Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you</line>
