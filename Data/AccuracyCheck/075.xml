    <stanza>
      <line>So are you to my thoughts as food to life</line>
      <line>Or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground</line>
      <line>And for the peace of you I hold such strife</line>
      <line>As twixt a miser and his wealth is found</line>
      <line>Now proud as an enjoyer and anon</line>
      <line>Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure</line>
      <line>Now counting best to be with you alone</line>
      <line>Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure</line>
      <line>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight</line>
      <line>And by and by clean starved for a look</line>
      <line>Possessing or pursuing no delight</line>
      <line>Save what is had or must from you be took</line>
      <line>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day</line>
      <line>Or gluttoning on all or all away</line>
    </stanza>
