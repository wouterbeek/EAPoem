    <stanza>
      <line>Those hours that with gentle work did frame</line>
      <line>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</line>
      <line>Will play the tyrants to the very same</line>
      <line>And that unfair which fairly doth excel</line>
      <line>For never resting time leads summer on</line>
      <line>To hideous winter and confounds him there</line>
      <line>Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone</line>
      <line>Beauty oer snowed and bareness every where</line>
      <line>Then were not summer distillation left</line>
      <line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass</line>
      <line>Beauty effect with beauty were bereft</line>
      <line>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was</line>
      <line>But flowers distilled though they with winter meet</line>
      <line>Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet</line>
