      <line>So am I as the rich whose blessed key</line>
      <line>Can bring him to his sweet up<phoneme category="b">treasure</phoneme><phoneme category="b">treasure</phoneme></line>
      <line>The which he will not every hour survey</line>
      <line>For blunting the fine point of<phoneme category="b">pleasure</phoneme><phoneme category="b">pleasure</phoneme></line>
      <line>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare</line>
      <line>Since seldom coming in that long year set</line>
      <line>Like stones of worth they thinly<phoneme category="c">are</phoneme><phoneme category="c">are</phoneme></line>
      <line>Or captain jewels in the carcanet</line>
      <line>So is the time that keeps you as my<phoneme category="e">chest</phoneme></line>
      <line>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth<phoneme category="f">hide</phoneme></line>
      <line>To make some special instant special<phoneme category="e">blest</phoneme></line>
      <line>By new unfolding his imprisoned<phoneme category="f">pride</phoneme></line>
      <line>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives<phoneme category="g">scope</phoneme></line>
      <line>Being had to triumph being lacked to<phoneme category="g">hope</phoneme></line>
