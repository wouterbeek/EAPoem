    <stanza>
      <line>Against my love shall be as I am now</line>
      <line>With Time injurious hand crushed and oerworn</line>
      <line>When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow</line>
      <line>With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn</line>
      <line>Hath travelled on to age steepy night</line>
      <line>And all those beauties whereof now he king</line>
      <line>Are vanishing or vanished out of sight</line>
      <line>Stealing away the treasure of his spring</line>
      <line>For such a time do I now fortify</line>
      <line>Against confounding age cruel knife</line>
      <line>That he shall never cut from memory</line>
      <line>My sweet love beauty though my lover life</line>
      <line>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen</line>
      <line>And they shall live and he in them still green</line>
