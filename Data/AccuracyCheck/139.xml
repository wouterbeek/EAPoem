    <stanza>
      <line>O call not me to justify the wrong</line>
      <line>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart</line>
      <line>Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue</line>
      <line>Use power with power and slay me not by art</line>
      <line>Tell me thou lov elsewhere but in my sight</line>
      <line>Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside</line>
      <line>What need thou wound with cunning when thy might</line>
      <line>Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide</line>
      <line>Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows</line>
      <line>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies</line>
      <line>And therefore from my face she turns my foes</line>
      <line>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries</line>
      <line>Yet do not so but since I am near slain</line>
      <line>Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain</line>
