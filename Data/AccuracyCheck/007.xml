    <stanza>
      <line>Lo in the orient when the gracious light</line>
      <line>Lifts up his burning head each under eye</line>
      <line>Doth homage to his new appearing sight</line>
      <line>Serving with looks his sacred majesty</line>
      <line>And having climbed the steep up heavenly hill</line>
      <line>Resembling strong youth in his middle age</line>
      <line>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still</line>
      <line>Attending on his golden pilgrimage</line>
      <line>But when from highmost pitch with weary car</line>
      <line>Like feeble age he reeleth from the day</line>
      <line>The eyes fore duteous now converted are</line>
      <line>From his low tract and look another way</line>
      <line>So thou thy self out going in thy noon</line>
      <line>Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son</line>
    </stanza>
