    <stanza>
      <line>When I have seen by Time fell hand defaced</line>
      <line>The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age</line>
      <line>When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased</line>
      <line>And brass eternal slave to mortal rage</line>
      <line>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</line>
      <line>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore</line>
      <line>And the firm soil win of the watery main</line>
      <line>Increasing store with loss and loss with store</line>
      <line>When I have seen such interchange of State</line>
      <line>Or state it self confounded to decay</line>
      <line>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate</line>
      <line>That Time will come and take my love away</line>
      <line>This thought is as a death which cannot choose</line>
      <line>But weep to have that which it fears to lose</line>
