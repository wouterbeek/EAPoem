    <stanza>
      <line>My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still</line>
      <line>While comments of your praise richly compiled</line>
      <line>Reserve their character with golden quill</line>
      <line>And precious phrase by all the Muses filed</line>
      <line>I think good thoughts whilst other write good words</line>
      <line>And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen</line>
      <line>To every hymn that able spirit affords</line>
      <line>In polished form of well refined pen</line>
      <line>Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true</line>
      <line>And to the most of praise add something more</line>
      <line>But that is in my thought whose love to you</line>
      <line>(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before</line>
      <line>Then others for the breath of words respect</line>
      <line>Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect</line>
    </stanza>
