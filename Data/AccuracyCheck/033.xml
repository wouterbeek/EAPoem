    <stanza>
      <line>Full many a glorious morning have I seen</line>
      <line>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye</line>
      <line>Kissing with golden face the meadows green</line>
      <line>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy</line>
      <line>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride</line>
      <line>With ugly rack on his celestial face</line>
      <line>And from the forlorn world his visage hide</line>
      <line>Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace</line>
      <line>Even so my sun one early morn did shine</line>
      <line>With all triumphant splendour on my brow</line>
      <line>But out alack he was but one hour mine</line>
      <line>The region cloud hath masked him from me now</line>
      <line>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth</line>
      <line>Suns of the world may stain when heaven sun staineth</line>
