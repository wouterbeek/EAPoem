    <stanza>
      <line>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</line>
      <line>Admit impediments love is not love</line>
      <line>Which alters when it alteration finds</line>
      <line>Or bends with the remover to remove</line>
      <line>O no it is an ever fixed mark</line>
      <line>That looks on tempests and is never shaken</line>
      <line>It is the star to every wandring bark</line>
      <line>Whose worth unknown although his height be taken</line>
      <line>Love not Time fool though rosy lips and cheeks</line>
      <line>Within his bending sickle compass come</line>
      <line>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks</line>
      <line>But bears it out even to the edge of doom</line>
      <line>If this be error and upon me proved</line>
      <line>I never writ nor no man ever loved</line>
