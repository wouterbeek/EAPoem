    <stanza>
      <line>Two loves I have of comfort and despair</line>
      <line>Which like two spirits do suggest me still</line>
      <line>The better angel is a man right fair</line>
      <line>The worser spirit a woman coloured ill</line>
      <line>To win me soon to hell my female evil</line>
      <line>Tempteth my better angel from my side</line>
      <line>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil</line>
      <line>Wooing his purity with her foul pride</line>
      <line>And whether that my angel be turned fiend</line>
      <line>Suspect I may yet not directly tell</line>
      <line>But being both from me both to each friend</line>
      <line>I guess one angel in another hell</line>
      <line>Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt</line>
      <line>Till my bad angel fire my good one out</line>
