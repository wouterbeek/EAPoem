    <stanza>
      <line>Like as to make our appetite more<phoneme category="a">keen</phoneme></line>
      <line>With eager compounds we our palate<phoneme category="b">urge</phoneme></line>
      <line>As to prevent our maladies<phoneme category="a">unseen</phoneme></line>
      <line>We sicken to shun sickness when we<phoneme category="b">purge</phoneme></line>
      <line>Even so being full of your neer cloying sweetness</line>
      <line>To bitter sauces did I frame my<phoneme category="d">feeding</phoneme></line>
      <line>And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness</line>
      <line>To be diseased ere that there was true<phoneme category="d">needing</phoneme></line>
      <line>Thus policy in love t anticipate</line>
      <line>The ills that were not grew to faults<phoneme category="f">assured</phoneme></line>
      <line>And brought to medicine a healthful state</line>
      <line>Which rank of goodness would by ill be<phoneme category="f">cured</phoneme></line>
      <line>But thence I learn and find the lesson<phoneme category="g">true</phoneme></line>
      <line>Drugs poison him that so feil sick of<phoneme category="g">you</phoneme></line>
