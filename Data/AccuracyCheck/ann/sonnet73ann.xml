    <stanza>
      <line>That time of year thou mayst in me<phoneme category="a">behold</phoneme></line>
      <line>When yellow leaves or none or few do<phoneme category="b">hang</phoneme></line>
      <line>Upon those boughs which shake against the<phoneme category="a">cold</phoneme></line>
      <line>Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds<phoneme category="b">sang</phoneme></line>
      <line>In me thou seest the twilight of such day</line>
      <line>As after sunset fadeth in the<phoneme category="d">west</phoneme></line>
      <line>Which by and by black night doth take away</line>
      <line>Death second self that seals up all in<phoneme category="d">rest</phoneme></line>
      <line>In me thou seest the glowing of such fire</line>
      <line>That on the ashes of his youth doth<phoneme category="f">lie</phoneme></line>
      <line>As the death bed whereon it must expire</line>
      <line>Consumed with that which it was nourished<phoneme category="f">by</phoneme></line>
      <line>This thou perceiv which makes thy love more<phoneme category="g">strong</phoneme></line>
      <line>To love that well which thou must leave ere<phoneme category="g">long</phoneme></line>
