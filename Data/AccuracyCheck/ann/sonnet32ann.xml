    <stanza>
      <line>If thou survive my well contented day</line>
      <line>When that churl death my bones with dust shall<phoneme category="b">cover</phoneme></line>
      <line>And shalt by fortune once more re survey</line>
      <line>These poor rude lines of thy deceased<phoneme category="b">lover</phoneme></line>
      <line>Compare them with the bettring of the<phoneme category="c">time</phoneme></line>
      <line>And though they be outstripped by every<phoneme category="d">pen</phoneme></line>
      <line>Reserve them for my love not for their<phoneme category="c">rhyme</phoneme></line>
      <line>Exceeded by the height of happier<phoneme category="d">men</phoneme></line>
      <line>O then vouchsafe me but this loving<phoneme category="e">thought</phoneme></line>
      <line>Had my friend Muse grown with this growing age</line>
      <line>A dearer birth than this his love had<phoneme category="e">brought</phoneme></line>
      <line>To march in ranks of better equipage</line>
      <line>But since he died and poets better prove</line>
      <line>Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love</line>
