    <stanza>
      <line>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse</line>
      <line>Bound for the prize of all too precious you</line>
      <line>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse</line>
      <line>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew</line>
      <line>Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write</line>
      <line>Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead</line>
      <line>No neither he nor his compeers by night</line>
      <line>Giving him aid my verse astonished</line>
      <line>He nor that affable familiar ghost</line>
      <line>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence</line>
      <line>As victors of my silence cannot boast</line>
      <line>I was not sick of any fear from thence</line>
      <line>But when your countenance filled up his line</line>
      <line>Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine</line>
