    <stanza>
      <line>Those lines that I before have writ do lie</line>
      <line>Even those that said I could not love you dearer</line>
      <line>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</line>
      <line>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer</line>
      <line>But reckoning time whose millioned accidents</line>
      <line>Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings</line>
      <line>Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp intents</line>
      <line>Divert strong minds to the course of altring things</line>
      <line>Alas why fearing of time tyranny</line>
      <line>Might I not then say Now I love you best</line>
      <line>When I was certain oer incertainty</line>
      <line>Crowning the present doubting of the rest</line>
      <line>Love is a babe then might I not say so</line>
      <line>To give full growth to that which still doth grow</line>
