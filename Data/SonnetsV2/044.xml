    <stanza>
      <line>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought</line>
      <line>Injurious distance should not stop my way</line>
      <line>For then despite of space I would be brought</line>
      <line>From limits far remote where thou dost stay</line>
      <line>No matter then although my foot did stand</line>
      <line>Upon the farthest earth removed from thee</line>
      <line>For nimble thought can jump both sea and land</line>
      <line>As soon as think the place where he would be</line>
      <line>But ah thought kills me that I am not thought</line>
      <line>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone</line>
      <line>But that so much of earth and water wrought</line>
      <line>I must attend time leisure with my moan</line>
      <line>Receiving nought by elements so slow</line>
      <line>But heavy tears badges of either woe</line>
