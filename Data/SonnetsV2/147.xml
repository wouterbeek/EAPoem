    <stanza>
      <line>My love is as a fever longing still</line>
      <line>For that which longer nurseth the disease</line>
      <line>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill</line>
      <line>Th uncertain sickly appetite to please</line>
      <line>My reason the physician to my love</line>
      <line>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept</line>
      <line>Hath left me and I desperate now approve</line>
      <line>Desire is death which physic did except</line>
      <line>Past cure I am now reason is past care</line>
      <line>And frantic-mad with evermore unrest</line>
      <line>My thoughts and my discourse as mad men are</line>
      <line>At random from the truth vainly expressed</line>
      <line>For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright</line>
      <line>Who art as black as hell as dark as night</line>
