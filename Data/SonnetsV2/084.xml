    <stanza>
      <line>Who is it that says most which can say more</line>
      <line>Than this rich praise that you alone are you</line>
      <line>In whose confine immured is the store</line>
      <line>Which should example where your equal grew</line>
      <line>Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</line>
      <line>That to his subject lends not some small glory</line>
      <line>But he that writes of you if he can tell</line>
      <line>That you are you so dignifies his story</line>
      <line>Let him but copy what in you is writ</line>
      <line>Not making worse what nature made so clear</line>
      <line>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit</line>
      <line>Making his style admired every where</line>
      <line>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse</line>
      <line>Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse</line>
    </stanza>
