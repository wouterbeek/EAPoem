    <stanza>
      <line>If my dear love were but the child of state</line>
      <line>It might for Fortune bastard be unfathered</line>
      <line>As subject to time love or to time hate</line>
      <line>Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered</line>
      <line>No it was builded far from accident</line>
      <line>It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls</line>
      <line>Under the blow of thralled discontent</line>
      <line>Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls</line>
      <line>It fears not policy that heretic</line>
      <line>Which works on leases of short-numbered hours</line>
      <line>But all alone stands hugely politic</line>
      <line>That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers</line>
      <line>To this I witness call the fools of time</line>
      <line>Which die for goodness who have lived for crime</line>
