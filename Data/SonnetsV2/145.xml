    <stanza>
      <line>Those lips that Love own hand did make</line>
      <line>Breathed forth the sound that said I hate</line>
      <line>To me that languished for her sake</line>
      <line>But when she saw my woeful state</line>
      <line>Straight in her heart did mercy come</line>
      <line>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet</line>
      <line>Was used in giving gentle doom</line>
      <line>And taught it thus anew to greet</line>
      <line>I hate she altered with an end</line>
      <line>That followed it as gentle day</line>
      <line>Doth follow night who like a fiend</line>
      <line>From heaven to hell is flown away</line>
      <line>I hate from hate away she threw</line>
      <line>And saved my life saying not you</line>
