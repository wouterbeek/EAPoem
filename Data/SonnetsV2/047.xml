    <stanza>
      <line>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took</line>
      <line>And each doth good turns now unto the other</line>
      <line>When that mine eye is famished for a look</line>
      <line>Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother</line>
      <line>With my love picture then my eye doth feast</line>
      <line>And to the painted banquet bids my heart</line>
      <line>Another time mine eye is my heart guest</line>
      <line>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part</line>
      <line>So either by thy picture or my love</line>
      <line>Thy self away art present still with me</line>
      <line>For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move</line>
      <line>And I am still with them and they with thee</line>
      <line>Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight</line>
      <line>Awakes my heart to heart and eye delight</line>
