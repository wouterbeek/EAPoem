    <stanza>
      <line>The forward violet thus did I chide</line>
      <line>Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells</line>
      <line>If not from my love breath The purple pride</line>
      <line>Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells</line>
      <line>In my love veins thou hast too grossly dyed</line>
      <line>The lily I condemned for thy hand</line>
      <line>And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair</line>
      <line>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand</line>
      <line>One blushing shame another white despair</line>
      <line>A third nor red nor white had stoln of both</line>
      <line>And to his robbery had annexed thy breath</line>
      <line>But for his theft in pride of all his growth</line>
      <line>A vengeful canker eat him up to death</line>
      <line>More flowers I noted yet I none could see</line>
      <line>But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee</line>
